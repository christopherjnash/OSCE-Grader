⚙️ Customizing the Grading Prompt

The script grades section-by-section for higher accuracy.

You can modify the grading prompt in config.py without editing JSON.

Example:

SYSTEM MESSAGE:  
"I am a medical educator, and I need your help grading an assignment.  
My students recently completed an OSCE post-encounter note based on a standardized patient interview.  
I have provided a structured scoring rubric with expected responses.  
The rubric is broken into individual sections. To ensure accuracy, please score each section separately.  
For each section, provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning before giving a final score.  
At the end of your evaluation, place the final score as an integer on a new line with no markup."

Modify this text in config.py if your institution requires a different approach.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle-aged man with a 1-day history of intense right sided flank pain with associated nausea and vomiting. He has had dysuria and and had increased urinary frequency. He has not had a fever. He recently used a rowing machine at the gym which he has not done before. His past medical history is significant for gout. He has had no changes in his stool, changes in skin color or blood in his urine. 
Response: In evaluating the provided history of present illness (HPI) for Mr. Ryan against the answer key, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient reports "intense right sided flank pain," which aligns with the key symptom. However, the duration is noted as "1-day" instead of "x24 hours or acute," which is acceptable but not exact.
   
2. **Characteristics of pain**: The description of the pain is "intense," but it lacks the specification of being "sharp" or "spasms/colic every 1-2 hours." The pain severity is not provided in a quantifiable manner (i.e., no 9/10 pain rating).

3. **Associated symptoms**: The patient reports "associated nausea and vomiting," which is documented correctly. However, the vomiting is not specified as "clear or nonbloody/nonbilious."

4. **Dysuria and urinary frequency**: The patient mentions "dysuria and increased urinary frequency," which is relevant. However, the answer key specifies urgency, which is not mentioned here. 

5. **Negative findings**: The patient has "not had a fever" and has "no changes in stool, changes in skin color or blood in urine," which are pertinent negatives. However, it specifically states "no hematuria," which is not explicitly mentioned in the HPI.

Overall, while the HPI contains many elements of the key information, it is missing some specific descriptors and key negatives. The organization is clear, but it does lack some of the required detail.

Based on this evaluation, I would score this HPI as follows:

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vital signs: Temp: 99.7, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, O2 99% HEENT: EOM intact, PERRLA, no cervical LAD CV: No murmurs, rubs or gallops, dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ on both feet, no pedal edema Lungs: Equal breath sounds, no crackles or wheezes Abd: Bowel sounds normoactive, no tenderness in any quadrants, abdomen is soft, CVAT MSK: 5/5 strength in upper and lower extremities 
Response: In evaluating the provided physical exam findings against the rubric:

1. **Vital Signs**: The vital signs are documented and appear normal, which is good.
2. **HEENT**: The findings are clear and relevant, indicating no issues.
3. **CV**: The cardiovascular findings are well documented with specific details about the heart sounds and pulses.
4. **Lungs**: The lung examination is clear, noting equal breath sounds and absence of abnormal findings.
5. **Abdomen**: The abdomen is well assessed with no tenderness and a normal description, but notably lacks the positive costovertebral angle tenderness that is a key finding in the answer key.
6. **MSK**: The musculoskeletal findings are documented clearly with strength noted.

While the documentation is organized and detailed, it is missing the critical positive finding of costovertebral angle tenderness, which would be a pertinent positive. Therefore, the exam is mostly well organized and contains relevant information, but the omission of this key finding affects the overall completeness.

Based on the rubric, this would fall under a score of 3, as most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but it is missing a pertinent positive.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle aged man with a history of gout who presents with one day of right sided flank pain with vomiting and dysuria. 
Response: To evaluate this note based on the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements present in the statement provided.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The note states "one day of right sided flank pain," which indicates acute onset within the past 24 hours. This element is present.
2. **Right flank pain**: The note mentions "right sided flank pain," so this element is also present.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not specified in the note. Therefore, this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The note does not mention any characteristics of the pain such as spasms, colic, or waves. This element is also missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The note includes "vomiting" and "dysuria," which are optional elements. However, they do not substitute for the missing essential elements.

In summary:
- Present: Acute onset, right flank pain
- Missing: Intensity of pain, spasms/colic/waves
- Optional elements do not compensate for the missing essential elements.

According to the rubric, since there are two missing essential elements, the score would be a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1) Uric Acid Kidney stone 2) Pyelonephritis 3) Costochondritis 
Response: To evaluate the provided differential diagnosis against the rubric, we need to assess the consistency of the differential diagnosis with the findings from the interview, as well as how well the diagnoses are prioritized.

1) **Uric Acid Kidney Stone** - This is consistent with the findings of nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic, which is a correct interpretation of the symptoms related to kidney stones. It is relevant and prioritized correctly.

2) **Pyelonephritis** - This aligns with the UTI/pyelonephritis option from the answer key. It is also a pertinent differential diagnosis given the symptoms that may suggest a urinary tract infection or kidney infection. This is also prioritized correctly.

3) **Costochondritis** - This diagnosis does not align well with the findings related to the urinary symptoms and is not part of the answer key. While it may be relevant in some contexts, it is not appropriate for this specific case based on the patient's symptoms.

Overall, the first two diagnoses are appropriate and prioritized correctly, but the inclusion of costochondritis introduces a flaw in the differentiation. The differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, with minor flaws in prioritization due to the irrelevant diagnosis.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is most likely presenting with a kidney stone. Given his history of gout it is likely a uric acid kidney stone. This is supported by his flank pain, CVAT, dehydration, and nausea and vomiting. He could also have pyelonephritis which is less likely due to lack of fever and other systemic systems but would be supported by his CVAT, dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Finally, he could just have costochondritis due to using the rowing machine at the gym which he had not done previously. 
Response: The student's differential diagnosis includes nephrolithiasis as the primary diagnosis, which is well supported by the patient’s symptoms such as right flank pain, nausea, and the history of gout, suggesting a uric acid kidney stone. The mention of costovertebral angle tenderness (CVAT) is also relevant to nephrolithiasis, although it is not explicitly stated in the answer key that CVAT was present in the patient's case. 

The student also correctly identifies pyelonephritis as a differential but notes that it is less likely due to the absence of fever and other systemic symptoms. This is a reasonable consideration, although they mistakenly mention dysuria and increased urinary frequency as supporting symptoms for pyelonephritis, which were not mentioned in the case. 

The inclusion of costochondritis as another possibility is valid, given the recent workout, but it does not directly relate to the primary symptoms of flank pain and nausea.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported, but there are some incorrect links (e.g., dysuria and urinary frequency for pyelonephritis) that do not significantly impact patient care. The primary diagnosis of nephrolithiasis is well supported, while the other considerations are valid but less relevant.

Therefore, I would score this section as a 3.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CT with IV contrast: will help to show size of the stone which will delineate therapy. Would also show pyelonephritis. UA and culture: Due to patient having dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Would put pyelonephritis higher on the differential if + for leukocytes and nitrites. CBC to show leukocytosis would make costochondritis less likely if WBC increased 
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup, the following points can be observed:

1. The plan includes a CT with IV contrast, which is an acceptable test according to the rubric. It is reasonable for assessing the size of a stone and potential pyelonephritis.
2. A UA and culture are included, which is required and directly addresses the patient's symptoms of dysuria and increased urinary frequency.
3. A CBC is also included, which is reasonable for evaluating leukocytosis and differentiating between conditions.

However, the plan lacks mention of the BMP and renal ultrasound, which are also acceptable tests according to the rubric. There are no unnecessary tests included, and the proposed tests are relevant to the differential diagnoses.

Considering these points, the plan is reasonable and includes most essential tests while not including any unnecessary tests, which aligns with a score of 3.

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a middle aged man with a history of gout who presents with one day of right sided flank pain with vomiting and dysuria. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1) Uric Acid Kidney stone 2) Pyelonephritis 3) Costochondritis 

Supporting Information:
Mr. Ryan is most likely presenting with a kidney stone. Given his history of gout it is likely a uric acid kidney stone. This is supported by his flank pain, CVAT, dehydration, and nausea and vomiting. He could also have pyelonephritis which is less likely due to lack of fever and other systemic systems but would be supported by his CVAT, dysuria and increased urinary frequency.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr Ryan is a middle aged man with hx of gout who present today with complain of right flank pain that started 3 days ago. Per patient, he normally drinks 2-3 liter of fluids per day. Three days ago, he went to the gym to workout and after the gym he started having shooting pains in the right flank. He took tylenol but it did not help. The pain has cause him to vomit 2x. He denies fever, hematuria but did endorses burning pain with urination. Review of system is negative except what is reported in the hpi.
Response: To evaluate the provided HPI (History of Present Illness) against the rubric, we will identify the presence of key information and its organization.

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does mention right flank pain, but it states that it started 3 days ago instead of 24 hours or acute.
2. **Sharp**: The description of the pain is "shooting pains," which may not clearly indicate sharp pain.
3. **Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours**: The HPI does not mention spasms or colic.
4. **Severe or 9/10 pain**: There is no indication of the severity of the pain on a scale (e.g., 9/10).
5. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient reports vomiting twice, which aligns with the rubric. However, there is no mention of the nature of the vomit (clear, nonbloody, or nonbilious).
6. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient reports burning pain with urination, which indicates dysuria.
7. **No hematuria**: The patient denies hematuria, which is correctly documented.

Overall, while some key elements are included, there are significant omissions and disorganization in the HPI. The history is not concise, and there are missing details that would be considered pertinent negatives (such as the nature of the vomit and the severity of the pain). 

Based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 2, as many key historical findings are omitted and the history is somewhat disorganized.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: VS: BP: 128/82; HR:85; RR: 16 TM: 99.2; SPO2: 99 on RA HEENT: NC/AT, nares patent and nml hearing, No LAN Resp: Nml resp. effort, CTAB, absent wheezes or rale CVD: Nml S!, S2, no edema , pulse +2 Abd: Nml BS, no point tenderness. Right CVA tenderness on Palpation MSK; 5/5 LE and UE strength Neuro: No focal deficit. Absent patellar reflex Skin: No skin lesion 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to identify the key components that should be included based on the answer key.

1. **Normal vitals**: The vital signs are provided and appear normal, which aligns with the answer key.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The documentation states "Right CVA tenderness on Palpation," which matches the answer key requirement.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The note states "no point tenderness," which implies there is no abdominal tenderness, aligning with the answer key.

Now, let's assess the organization and conciseness of the findings:
- The vital signs are clearly listed at the beginning.
- Each system is addressed in a structured manner (HEENT, Respiratory, Cardiovascular, Abdomen, Musculoskeletal, Neurological, Skin).
- There is no irrelevant information, and the findings are concise.

However, the note does not explicitly mention any pertinent negatives that could enhance the documentation, such as "no jaundice" or "no cyanosis," which are often relevant in a physical exam.

Based on this evaluation:
- The note contains almost all key findings from the answer key and is well organized.
- It is concise, but it lacks some pertinent negatives.

Considering these points, I would score this section as a 3.

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Kidney stone 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Hydro nephritis due to stone
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes:

1. Kidney stone
2. Pyelonephritis
3. Hydronephritis due to stone

Let's evaluate this against the rubric:

- The first two diagnoses (kidney stone and pyelonephritis) are correct and consistent with the findings typically associated with renal colic and urinary symptoms. 
- However, the third diagnosis, "hydronephritis due to stone," while related to the first diagnosis, is not one of the specific diagnoses listed in the answer key. It could be considered a consequence of a kidney stone rather than a distinct differential diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, but the inclusion of "hydronephritis due to stone" introduces a minor flaw in prioritization since it is not explicitly listed in the answer key, which could lead to a broader interpretation.

Based on this assessment, the score would be a 3, as the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care.

- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Kidney stone: Recent training wthout adequate fluid, CVA tendernes and shooting flank pain 2. Pyelonephritis: Buringing pain with urination but lack of fever, unilateral CVA are against 3. Hydronephritis due to stone: Could likely to be present as a complication of the stone
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided:

1. **Kidney stone**: The reasoning mentions recent training without adequate fluid intake, which is relevant to the development of nephrolithiasis. However, it incorrectly states "CVA tenderness," which is not mentioned in the provided information about kidney stones. The mention of "shooting flank pain" aligns with the diagnosis but lacks specificity. Overall, the link is partially supported but contains inaccuracies.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: The reasoning notes burning pain with urination, which is relevant. However, it correctly points out the absence of fever and unilateral CVA tenderness, which do not support this diagnosis. This section has some appropriate links but ultimately fails to provide strong support for pyelonephritis given the lack of key symptoms.

3. **Hydronephrosis due to stone**: This diagnosis is presented as a potential complication of the stone, which is a reasonable consideration. However, it lacks direct patient findings to support this diagnosis and does not provide a clear link to the symptoms presented.

Overall, the differential diagnosis shows some understanding but contains several incorrect or weak links between findings and diagnoses. The support for the kidney stone is somewhat reasonable, but the other two diagnoses are not adequately supported. Therefore, I would rate this as a weakly supported differential diagnosis.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. UA, CBC, and CMP 2. US , xray/CT if US is not definitive; Some stones are not visible on xray. 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan against the rubric:

1. The plan includes a UA, which is required.
2. The inclusion of CBC and CMP is not mentioned in the answer key as either required or acceptable; they are not essential for the diagnostic workup in this context.
3. The plan mentions a renal ultrasound (US), which is acceptable.
4. The plan also suggests x-ray/CT if the ultrasound is not definitive. While this is a reasonable approach, it introduces unnecessary tests since the CT abdomen/pelvis was not specifically mentioned as acceptable in the context of this patient’s symptoms.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and an acceptable US, but it also includes unnecessary tests (CBC, CMP, and potential CT/x-ray) that do not align with the essential tests outlined in the answer key. Therefore, it does not effectively meet the criteria for an efficient diagnostic workup.

Given this analysis, the score for the plan is:

Right CVA tenderness on Palpation MSK; 5/5 LE and UE strength Neuro: No focal deficit. Absent patellar reflex Skin: No skin lesion 

Summary:
Mr Ryan is a middle aged man with hx of gout who present today with complain of right flank pain and right CVA tenderness

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Kidney stone 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Hydro nephritis due to stone

Supporting Information:
1. Kidney stone: Recent training wthout adequate fluid, CVA tendernes and shooting flank pain 2. Pyelonephritis: Buringing pain with urination but lack of fever, unilateral CVA are against 3. Hydronephritis due to stone: Could likely to be present as a complication of the stone

Plan:
1. UA, CBC, and CMP 2. US , xray/CT if US is not definitive; Some stones are not visible on xray. 


Response: The organization of the provided note is generally clear, with distinct sections for History of Present Illness, Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section is appropriately labeled and contains relevant information pertaining to Mr. Ryan's case. 

However, there are minor issues that affect the overall organization. For instance, the "Supporting Information" section could have been better delineated with clearer bullet points or formatting to enhance readability. Additionally, there are a few typographical errors (e.g., "Buringing pain" instead of "Burning pain" and "CVA tendernes" instead of "CVA tenderness") that may detract from the professionalism of the note.

Overall, while the note is mostly organized with the required sections present, the minor disorganization and typographical errors warrant a score that reflects these issues.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a middle aged man with a history of gout that presents with one day of right sided flank pain. He first noticed the pain yesterday afternoon and describes it as dull and always there, but occasionally "zaps" all of the sudden. He has tried Tylenol with no relief. He describes the pain as a 9/10 at its worst. The pain is accompanied by nausea and he has vomited twice since yesterday. He does not believe the pain to be associated with anything such as eating or drinking. He has never had this pain in the past. The pain was so severe he had to leave work yesterday and did not return today. He complains of burning with urination and urinary frequency that he noticed yesterday evening. He denies blood in urine or changes in bowel movements. ROS: He complains of dysuria and urinary frequency, denies gross hematuria. Complains of nausea and vomiting associated with pain. His energy level is unchanged. Denies HA, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain. No dietary changes, drinks plenty of fluids. PMH - gout, no flare ups in last several years PSH - none Meds - none Allergies - none FH - father with HTN and diabetes. Mother had cholecystectomy secondary to gallstones. Siblings in good health SH - lives at home with wife, works as a manager at an insurance company
Response: To evaluate the provided HPI against the rubric, let's break down the key components:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does report right-sided flank pain, but he describes it as dull rather than sharp. This is a deviation from the expected description.
2. **Duration**: The duration of "one day" is consistent with the rubric's requirement of "x24 hours or acute."
3. **Nature of pain**: The description of pain as "dull" and "zaps" does not align with the requirement for it to be sharp or spasmodic/colicky.
4. **Severity**: The patient rates the pain as 9/10 at its worst, which is appropriately documented.
5. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are mentioned, with the vomiting being described as clear and nonbloody/nonbilious, which is in line with the rubric.
6. **Dysuria and urgency**: The patient complains of burning with urination and urinary frequency, which is documented correctly.
7. **Hematuria**: The patient denies blood in urine, which aligns with the rubric's requirement.

Overall, while the HPI contains many key components, there are significant omissions and inaccuracies, particularly in the description of the pain (dull instead of sharp and the absence of spasms/colic). The organization is relatively clear, but the inaccuracies and omissions in key findings detract from the overall quality.

Based on these considerations, I would assign a score of 2.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 O2 99% HEENT: PERRL, normal extraoccular movement, normal dentition, moist mucus membranes, no lymphadenopathy CV: normal rate and rhythm, no murmurs, no S3 or S4, normal posterior tibial pulses, no LE edema Resp: normal breath sounds GI: normal inspection, normal bowel sounds, no tenderness to palpation. Right CVA tenderness to palpation MSK: normal strength in upper and lower extremities, normal gait
Response: The provided physical exam findings include both normal and abnormal findings, but they are somewhat disorganized. 

1. Normal vitals are documented, which is in line with the key.
2. Positive costovertebral angle tenderness is noted with "Right CVA tenderness to palpation," which aligns with the required findings.
3. However, while there are many normal findings documented, the absence of pertinent negatives is notable. For example, while abdominal tenderness is mentioned as "no tenderness to palpation," it is not explicitly stated that there is no CVA tenderness on the left side, which could be considered a pertinent negative in this context.

Overall, while the majority of key positive findings are documented, the organization is somewhat cluttered with extensive detail and lacks some pertinent negatives, which affects clarity.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a middle aged man with a history of gout that presents with acute colicky right flank pain, dysuria and urinary frequency concerning for nephrolithiasis. 
Response: To evaluate the provided statement against the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements based on the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "acute," which satisfies this requirement.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement includes "right flank pain," meeting this criterion.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity is not specified in the statement, which means this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The term "colicky" indicates the presence of spasms, satisfying this requirement.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement mentions "dysuria and urinary frequency," which are not included in the optional elements listed. However, it does not include any of the optional elements specified (like non-bilious vomiting or right groin pain), but this is not necessary for scoring.

Now, let's summarize the findings:

- Essential elements present: 3 (acute onset, right flank pain, spasms)
- Missing: 1 essential element (intensity)
- Total elements: 5 (acute onset, right flank pain, 10/10 intensity missing, spasms, dysuria/urinary frequency not counted as essential)

Based on the rubric:
- Since 1 essential element is missing, the score would be a 3.

Final Score: 3

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. nephrolithiasis 2. pyelonephritis 3. renal infarct 
Response: To evaluate the provided differential diagnosis against the rubric, we need to consider how well the diagnoses align with the patient's symptoms and the expected findings based on the answer key.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: This is consistent with the findings and is the top diagnosis in the answer key.
2. **Pyelonephritis**: This is also consistent with the findings and is the second diagnosis in the answer key.
3. **Renal infarct**: This diagnosis is not included in the answer key and is less likely given the context of the symptoms typically associated with nephrolithiasis and UTI/pyelonephritis.

The first two diagnoses are correct and prioritized well, but the inclusion of renal infarct introduces a flaw in the differential diagnosis, making it somewhat inconsistent with the findings.

Given that the first two diagnoses are correct and prioritized appropriately, but the third diagnosis is not aligned with the expected findings, I would assess this as having minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care.

Based on the rubric, this would score as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Kidney stones most likely diagnosis. Though patient does not have a family history of stones, this could be idiopathic, or related to his gout forming uric acid stones. Patient has classic presentation including acute onset, colicky flank pain that is severe. 2. Pyelonephritis less likely since no history of UTI, but must rule out due to location of pain and symptoms of dysuria. Patient is also afebrile making this less likely. 3. Renal infarct - could cause acute flank pain, less likely, no history of CAD or atherosclerosis
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes the following:

1. **Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis)**: The reasoning is strong, as it highlights the classic presentation of acute, severe, colicky flank pain and connects it to the patient's history of gout, which can lead to uric acid stones. The lack of a family history is acknowledged, but the explanation of idiopathic causes is appropriate. This aligns well with the rubric's criteria for an excellent differential diagnosis.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: The rationale is appropriate but has some missing links. The mention of ruling it out due to the absence of a UTI history and the patient being afebrile is relevant. However, the explanation could be improved by noting the need to assess for costovertebral angle tenderness, which is a key finding in pyelonephritis. The reasoning is sound, but the links are not completely correct or complete, which would fit more into the "appropriately supported" category.

3. **Renal infarct**: This diagnosis is mentioned but is weakly supported. The reasoning indicates it could cause acute flank pain, but the lack of a history of CAD or atherosclerosis is not a strong enough link to dismiss it as a differential diagnosis. This section lacks accurate links to patient findings and does not provide a compelling rationale for its inclusion.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is mostly strong but contains some inaccuracies and missing links, particularly in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal infarct. Therefore, it fits best into the second category of the rubric.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Will collect a UA to look for hematuria which would be more suggestive of stones. If positive for leukocyte esterase and nitrates will do urine culture to rule out infection. Will do CT non contrast stone protocol to look for nephrolithiasis. If stone is found will do pain control and encourage hydration. Will see patient back in 4-6 to confirm stone passage and discuss possible ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy if still symptomatic.
Response: The plan provided includes the following elements:

1. **UA**: This is required and is included in the plan to look for hematuria, which is appropriate.
2. **CT non-contrast stone protocol**: This is an acceptable test for nephrolithiasis and is included in the plan.
3. **Urine culture**: This is a reasonable additional test if the UA is positive for leukocyte esterase and nitrates, as it helps rule out infection, which is relevant to the symptoms.
4. **Pain control and hydration**: While these are important management strategies, they do not fall under the diagnostic workup.
5. **Follow-up plan**: Seeing the patient back in 4-6 weeks to confirm stone passage and discuss further interventions is appropriate but is more related to management than to the diagnostic workup.

Overall, the plan includes the essential tests (UA and CT), a reasonable additional test (urine culture), and no unnecessary tests. It does not include any irrelevant tests or "shotgunning."

Based on the rubric, this plan would fit into the category of a "reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests." However, since it primarily focuses on the essential tests and does not include unnecessary tests, it aligns more closely with the definition for a score of 4.

ROS: negative for constipation, diarrhea, cp, SOA PMH: Gout 2 years ago right toe (not currently taking medication) Meds: none Surg: none Hospitalizations: none Fam Hx: mom-cholecystitis with cholecystectomy, dad-DM and HTN Soc Hx: alcohol on occasion, no tobacco or drug use 
Response: In evaluating the provided history of present illness (HPI) for Nathaniel Ryan, we need to assess the key components against the rubric criteria.

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does report right-sided pain, but it is specified as "right sided pain that radiates to his back," which somewhat deviates from the clear identification of "right flank pain."
2. **Duration**: The duration is correctly noted as "24 hours."
3. **Quality of pain**: The pain is described as "sharp," which aligns with the rubric.
4. **Spasms or colic**: The patient mentions "spasms every few hours," which does not clearly match the expected frequency of "every 1-2 hours." This could be interpreted as less precise.
5. **Severity**: The patient reports pain as "2/10 when stable but 9/10 during a spasm episode," which meets the requirement for severe pain documentation.
6. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient reports nausea and vomiting, but there is no mention of whether the vomiting is clear, nonbloody, or nonbilious.
7. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient mentions dysuria with increased frequency, which is relevant.
8. **Hematuria**: There is no mention of hematuria, which is a pertinent negative.

Overall, the HPI contains most of the key elements, but some details are either vague or missing. The organization is somewhat clear, but the deviations from the expected wording and the absence of specific details (e.g., the nature of the vomiting and the exact frequency of spasms) detract from its completeness.

Based on this evaluation, I would score this HPI as a 3, as it contains most key positive historical findings but misses some pertinent negatives and has slight disorganization in the presentation.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp 99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, O2 sat 99% on RA General: normal appearing male in no acute distress HEENT: normocephalic, atraumatic, PERRLA, no scleral icterus, no cervical lymphadenopathy, mucous membranes moist Cardio: RRR, no lesions on chest, no edema, pedal pulses 2+ Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd/GI: BS present. No tenderness, rebound, or guarding. No masses or lesions. GU: right CVA tenderness MSK: Strength 5+ in all extremities Neuro: gait normal 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to analyze the presence and organization of the key findings as specified in the answer key.

1. **Normal vitals**: The vitals are documented and appear normal.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: This finding is missing; instead, there is documentation of "right CVA tenderness," which suggests that the expected positive finding is not correctly reported.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: This is documented as "No tenderness, rebound, or guarding," which indicates that the pertinent negative is present.

In summary, the physical exam findings include normal vitals and a well-organized examination; however, the key finding of positive costovertebral angle tenderness is inaccurately documented as right CVA tenderness. Therefore, while most of the key findings are present and organized, the omission of the correct positive finding affects the overall score.

Based on the rubric:
- The presence of normal vitals and well-organized documentation is a positive aspect.
- The incorrect documentation of CVA tenderness and the absence of the expected positive finding detracts from the score.

Considering these factors, the student’s performance aligns most closely with a score of 2, as many key findings are present but the key positive finding is omitted, and the exam is somewhat detailed.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 50 year old male who presents with acute onset nausea, vomiting, and dysuria with CVA tenderness on exam.
Response: To evaluate the provided statement against the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements from the answer key and check which ones are present or missing.

The essential elements from the answer key are:
1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2. Right flank pain
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional: Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile.

Now, let's analyze the statement:

- "Acute onset" is present (meets the first criteria).
- "Right flank pain" is missing.
- "10/10 intensity OR severe intensity" is missing.
- "Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves" is missing.
- The optional elements include "nausea" and "vomiting," but these do not match the optional criteria provided.

Based on this analysis:
- The statement includes only 1 essential element (acute onset) and is missing 3 other essential elements (right flank pain, intensity, and spasms).
- Therefore, it falls under the category of "Missing multiple essential elements."

According to the rubric, the score for this evaluation is:

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis/UTI
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis/UTI. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is a correct interpretation of the findings, especially if the symptoms align with kidney stones.
2. Pyelonephritis and UTI are also relevant considerations, as they are commonly associated with urinary symptoms and can present similarly.

The differential diagnosis is pertinent and prioritizes nephrolithiasis first, which is appropriate if the symptoms suggest this condition. However, combining pyelonephritis and UTI into one category could be seen as slightly less precise since they have different implications and may require different management.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, with a minor flaw in the prioritization of the second item. This would not negatively impact patient care.

Based on this evaluation, I would score this section as a 3.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis- spasming episodic pain with CVA tenderness, dysuria, nausea/vomiting, pain not affected by position 2. Pyelonephritis- CVA tenderness with dysuria, nausea/vomiting
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we will analyze how well it supports the diagnoses based on the provided answer key.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: 
   - The note mentions "spasming episodic pain," which aligns with the description of right flank pain being sharp and intermittent. However, it does not specifically mention the severity of pain or that it is 9/10, which is a significant detail from the rubric.
   - The note includes "CVA tenderness," which is a key finding for nephrolithiasis, but it does not mention nausea/vomiting clearly.
   - The note states "pain not affected by position," which is somewhat relevant but does not directly correlate with the classic presentation of nephrolithiasis.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: 
   - The note mentions "CVA tenderness," which is appropriate for pyelonephritis, along with "dysuria" and "nausea/vomiting." However, it lacks the description of right flank pain, which is essential.
   - Overall, it correctly identifies CVA tenderness and nausea/vomiting but does not fully capture the acute nature of the right flank pain.

Overall, the differential diagnoses presented have some appropriate links but lack completeness and accuracy in correlating the findings to the diagnoses. The connections made are somewhat weak, and several key elements are missing or incorrectly linked, particularly concerning nephrolithiasis.

Based on the provided rubric:
- The differential diagnosis is weakly supported with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Right abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for stone (can consider abdominal CT without contrast if not well visualized). UA to look for infection/blood. CBC to look for signs of infection.
Response: The provided plan includes the following components:

1. Right abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for stone - This is an acceptable test.
2. Consideration of abdominal CT without contrast if not well visualized - This is also an acceptable test.
3. UA to look for infection/blood - This is a required test.
4. CBC to look for signs of infection - This is not listed in the acceptable tests.

The plan includes the required UA, and acceptable tests (ultrasound, CT), but it also includes a CBC, which is not necessary according to the rubric. The inclusion of the CBC indicates that the plan is not entirely efficient, as it includes some unnecessary tests.

Overall, the plan is reasonable and includes most essential tests, but it also includes some unnecessary tests. Therefore, it falls into the category of a reasonable plan with some unnecessary tests.

Response: To evaluate the provided HPI (History of Present Illness) against the rubric, we will assess the key components mentioned in the answer key:

1. **Right flank pain:** The student does mention right flank pain, which is good.
2. **Duration:** The student states the pain has been present for 2 days instead of the required "x24 hours or acute." This is a minor deviation but still relevant.
3. **Character:** The student describes the pain as "crampy" and "sharp," which aligns with the requirement.
4. **Spasms or colic:** The student mentions episodes of pain every 20 minutes, which could be interpreted as spasms or colic, but it is not explicitly stated.
5. **Severity:** The student rates the pain as 8-9/10 at its worst, which meets the requirement.
6. **Nausea and vomiting:** The student reports nausea and two episodes of non-bloody emesis, which is consistent with the rubric.
7. **Dysuria and/or urgency:** The student describes increased "pressure" upon urinating and increased frequency, which is relevant, but does not explicitly state dysuria or urgency.
8. **Hematuria:** The student denies hematuria, which is consistent with the rubric.

Overall, the key information is mostly present, and while there are some minor deviations (such as the pain duration and the lack of explicit mention of spasms or colic), the organization is relatively clear. The student documented most of the key findings but missed some pertinent negatives (like explicitly stating dysuria).

Based on this evaluation, I would score this section a 3.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: vitals temp 99.7, hr 85, bp 128/82, o2 on RA 99%, rr 16 physical exam: general = sitting on exam table with hands on knees with torso slightly bent over, appears mildly uncomfortable heent = appropriate dentition for age, no posterior oropharyngeal erythema or tonsillar exudates. PERRL. EOMI. cardio = normal s1 and s2, regular rate/rhythm, no m/r/g respiratory = good air movement bilaterally no wheezing rhonchi rales GI = non-distended and non-tender throughout, no organomegaly GU = no left-sided CVA tenderness. right-sided CVA tenderness to mild palpation (percussion deferred). back = no midline tenderness to the C/T/L spine neuro = grossly non-focal. gait appropriate. upper extremity (elbow flexion, elbow extension, shoulder abduction) and lower extremity strength (hip flexion, knee flexion, knee extension) 5/5 bilaterally. 
Response: To score this section, we need to evaluate the physical exam findings against the answer key provided.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs documented (temp 99.7, hr 85, bp 128/82, o2 on RA 99%, rr 16) show a slight elevation in temperature, which could indicate a potential issue. Thus, this does not fully align with "normal vitals."

2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The documentation indicates "right-sided CVA tenderness to mild palpation," which is a positive finding and aligns with the answer key.

3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The physical exam states "non-tender throughout," which aligns with the requirement of no abdominal tenderness.

Overall, the physical exam findings include some key findings but also have some discrepancies from the answer key. The vital signs are not entirely normal, and while there is a positive finding for CVA tenderness, it is only on the right side and does not mention the left side, which could be considered a missing pertinent negative. The organization of the exam findings is clear and well-structured.

Given these points, the score would likely fall between 2 and 3. Since the majority of key findings are documented but with some omissions and a minor issue with the normality of vitals, I would assign a score of 2.

Response: To evaluate the provided note based on the rubric:

1. The note mentions "acute-onset," which satisfies the first essential element.
2. It describes "right-sided flank pain," which satisfies the second essential element, but it does not specifically state "right flank pain" as per the answer key.
3. The intensity is described as "crampy/sharp" but does not mention "10/10 intensity" or "severe intensity," which means it does not meet the third essential element.
4. The note states "with radiation to the groin," which does not meet the fourth essential element, as it does not mention "spasms," "colic," or "pain comes in waves."
5. The note does not include any optional elements.

Based on these evaluations:
- The note is missing multiple essential elements (specifically elements 2, 3, and 4).
- It does not include a summary statement.

Thus, the score for this section is 1.

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. ureterolithiasis - acute onset sharp/crampy flank pain with CVA tenderness and, more specifically, with radiation to the groin is classically consistent with ureterolithiasis - majority of stones are calcium phosphate, however history of gout is a risk factor for stone formation (uric acid) - being middle aged, male, and having poor water intake are also risk factors 2. nephrolithiasis - same as above, however pain radiating to the groin area is more consistent with stone involving the ureter rather than kidney. 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we will compare it to the answer key and the rubric criteria.

1. The first diagnosis listed is "ureterolithiasis," which is essentially synonymous with nephrolithiasis, as both refer to the presence of stones in the urinary tract. The explanation provided accurately describes the symptoms (acute onset sharp/crampy flank pain with CVA tenderness and radiation to the groin) and identifies relevant risk factors (history of gout, being middle-aged, male, and poor water intake). This diagnosis is consistent with the findings and is well articulated.

2. The second diagnosis is "nephrolithiasis." The student correctly notes that the pain radiating to the groin is more consistent with ureterolithiasis but still identifies nephrolithiasis as a potential differential. This indicates an understanding of the conditions but slightly misprioritizes the specific type of stone-related pain. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall assessment, as nephrolithiasis is still a relevant diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis reflects a solid understanding of the patient's symptoms and includes appropriate prioritization. There are minor flaws in the prioritization of the two diagnoses, but they do not negatively impact patient care.

Based on the rubric:
- The differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. ureterolithiasis - acute onset sharp/crampy flank pain with CVA tenderness and, more specifically, with radiation to the groin is classically consistent with ureterolithiasis - majority of stones are calcium phosphate, however history of gout is a risk factor for stone formation (uric acid) - being middle aged, male, and having poor water intake are also risk factors 2. nephrolithiasis - same as above, however pain radiating to the groin area is more consistent with stone involving the ureter rather than kidney.
Response: The support provided gives a clear rationale for the differential diagnoses of ureterolithiasis and nephrolithiasis. The references to the acute onset of sharp flank pain, CVA tenderness, and radiation to the groin align well with the expected symptoms of nephrolithiasis. Additionally, the mention of risk factors such as gout and demographics (middle-aged male, poor water intake) further strengthens the argument for nephrolithiasis.

However, the inclusion of ureterolithiasis as a separate diagnosis, while relevant, does not directly align with the rubric's emphasis on the completeness and correctness of the links to diagnoses. The note does not mention UTI/pyelonephritis, muscle strain, or inguinal hernia, which could be seen as a gap in the differential diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well-supported, but it lacks completeness as it does not consider other potential diagnoses that could be relevant to the patient's symptoms.

Based on this evaluation, I would score this section as a 3, since it is appropriately supported but misses some links that could enhance patient care.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. CT abdomen (stone protocol) WITHOUT IV contrast - would allow for visualization of stone and location 2. urinalysis - feel that this is necessary to definitely rule out concomitant urinary tract infection (stone + infection is a urologic emergency) - would want to see if nitrates, bacteria, or leukocyte esterase are positive
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup against the rubric:

1. The plan includes a **CT abdomen (stone protocol) WITHOUT IV contrast**. This is an acceptable test as it allows visualization of stones, which is relevant given the patient's symptoms.
2. The plan also includes a **urinalysis**, which is a required test. The rationale provided for this test is sound, as it aims to rule out a urinary tract infection, which is indeed critical in the context of a potential urologic emergency.

The plan does not include any unnecessary tests and effectively addresses the essential diagnostic needs. Therefore, it falls under the category of a reasonable plan that includes most essential tests without including unnecessary ones.

Based on this evaluation, the score for the plan is:

Middle-aged male with history of gout (1) presenting with acute-onset (2) crampy/sharp right-sided flank pain (3) with radiation to the groin (4) and with pertinent physical exam finding of right-sided CVA tenderness to mild palpation (5). 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. ureterolithiasis - acute onset sharp/crampy flank pain with CVA tenderness and, more specifically, with radiation to the groin is classically consistent with ureterolithiasis - majority of stones are calcium phosphate, however history of gout is a risk factor for stone formation (uric acid) - being middle aged, male, and having poor water intake are also risk factors 2. nephrolithiasis - same as above, however pain radiating to the groin area is more consistent with stone involving the ureter rather than kidney. 

Supporting Information:
1. ureterolithiasis - acute onset sharp/crampy flank pain with CVA tenderness and, more specifically, with radiation to the groin is classically consistent with ureterolithiasis - majority of stones are calcium phosphate, however history of gout is a risk factor for stone formation (uric acid) - being middle aged, male, and having poor water intake are also risk factors 2. nephrolithiasis - same as above, however pain radiating to the groin area is more consistent with stone involving the ureter rather than kidney.

Response: The organization of the provided note is mostly clear and follows a logical structure. Each section is appropriately labeled, and the information is presented in a way that allows for easy understanding of the patient's case. 

1. The History of Present Illness (HPI) is detailed and captures the chief complaint as well as relevant symptoms, past medical history, and social history in a coherent manner.
2. The Physical Examination is systematically organized by systems, which makes it easy to follow.
3. The Summary succinctly encapsulates the key points of the case.
4. The Differential Diagnosis is clearly listed and provides a rationale for each diagnosis.
5. The Supporting Information section reiterates the differential diagnoses but does so in a manner that aligns with the previous section.
6. The Plan is clearly delineated and specifies the next steps in management.

While the note is comprehensive and well-organized, there is some minor repetition in the Differential Diagnosis and Supporting Information sections, which could be seen as slightly disorganized. However, the overall organization remains intact.

Given these observations, I would score this section as follows:

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI Mr. Nathanial Ryan is a 61 yo man with PMH of gout presenting with 24 hours of right flank pain. He states he was eating lunch at work as an insurance company manager yesterday with he suddenly developed right flank pain. There is continuous underlying pain, but the pain will sometimes worsen to severe pain for a few minutes. A couple times the pain has traveled down toward his groin and couple other times it has radiated toward his back. During this time, he has had nausea and two episodes of vomiting as well as urinary frequency, urgency, and occasional dysuria. He states this has never happened to him before. He mentions a few days ago he went to the gym to try out rowing, which left him with diffuse muscle soreness for a few days. Denies fever, chills, hematuria. ROS Gen- no fever, chills, HA Resp- no dyspnea CV- no chest pain, palpitations Abd- nausea, vomiting, right flank pain as described in HPI GU- urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria as described in HPI, denies hematuria MSK- recent diffuse muscle soreness following activity change PMH - Gout 2 years ago treated with medication and in remission - No allergies PSH- none Meds- no regular medications, but tried tylenol Family history Mother- gallstones Father- type 2 diabetes, HTN Social history Works as a manager at an insurance company Denies TOB use EtOH ~1x/month
Response: To evaluate the HPI provided, I will compare it against the key points outlined in the answer key.

1. **Right flank pain**: The student mentions right flank pain, which is correct.
2. **Duration**: The duration of 24 hours is stated, which is accurate.
3. **Nature of pain**: The student describes the pain as "continuous underlying pain" with episodes of severe pain, but does not explicitly mention "sharp" pain or "spasms/colic every 1-2 hours." This is a partial omission.
4. **Severity**: The student describes the pain as "severe" for a few minutes but does not quantify it with a 9/10 scale.
5. **Nausea and vomiting**: The student reports nausea and vomiting, which is appropriate. However, they do not specify that the vomiting is "clear or nonbloody/nonbilious."
6. **Dysuria and urgency**: The student mentions urinary frequency, urgency, and occasional dysuria, which aligns with the key points, but does not clearly state "dysuria and/or urgency" as two separate symptoms.
7. **Hematuria**: The student correctly denies hematuria.

Overall, while the student has included most of the key information, there are several important omissions and a lack of clarity in some areas, particularly regarding the nature of the pain, the specific severity scale, and the description of the vomiting. 

Based on the rubric:
- The note has some key information present, but it is missing critical details and lacks organization in parts.

This would fall under the score of 2: "Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key)."

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals temp- 99.7F HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 O2 99% on room air Gen- uncomfortable appearing, sitting up on exam table HENT- PERRL, moist mucous membranes, normal dentition and oropharynx, no LAD Resp- lungs CTAB CV- RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally Abd- right-sided costovertebral angle tenderness, no distension, TTP, normoactive bowel sounds MSK- 5/5 BUE and BLE strength Neuro- normal gait
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, let's break down the key elements based on the answer key:

1. **Normal Vitals**: The provided vitals (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) are all documented and appear normal, which aligns with the answer key.

2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The note mentions "right-sided costovertebral angle tenderness," which is a positive finding that matches the answer key.

3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The answer key states "no abdominal tenderness," but the provided note mentions "TTP" (tenderness to palpation) in the abdomen, which is a discrepancy. This indicates that a key negative finding is not documented accurately.

In summary, while the physical exam findings are mostly well organized and include many relevant details, the omission of the pertinent negative (no abdominal tenderness) and the presence of conflicting information (TTP) detracts from the overall quality of the documentation.

Therefore, based on the rubric:
- The presence of almost all key findings is noted, but the inaccuracies and omissions regarding pertinent negatives lead to a lower score.

Final score: 2

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Nathanial Ryan is a 61 yo man with PMH of gout presenting to the ED with acute-onset right-sided, severe, colicky flank pain with urinary changes.
Response: Let's evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric and the answer key.

1. The statement indicates "acute-onset," which corresponds to the first element.
2. It mentions "right-sided, severe, colicky flank pain," which covers the second and third elements (right flank pain and severe intensity).
3. The term "colicky" aligns with the fourth element (spasms/colic/pain comes in waves).
4. However, there is no mention of the optional elements, but since they are not essential, their absence does not affect the score.

Now, let's count the total elements present:
- Acute onset
- Right flank pain
- Severe intensity
- Colicky pain

This totals to 4 essential elements, which is within the required limit of 5 or fewer total elements.

Since all essential elements are present and the total does not exceed 5, the score is 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Muscle strain 3. Pyelonephritis
Response: The provided differential diagnoses include nephrolithiasis, muscle strain, and pyelonephritis. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is a correct and relevant diagnosis given the context of renal colic symptoms, which aligns well with the findings.
2. Muscle strain, while it may be a consideration in some cases of abdominal pain, is less relevant compared to the other diagnoses and does not directly relate to urinary symptoms.
3. Pyelonephritis is also a relevant diagnosis, especially if there are signs of infection or systemic symptoms.

Overall, the differential diagnosis includes one strong primary diagnosis (nephrolithiasis), a relevant secondary diagnosis (pyelonephritis), and an optional diagnosis (muscle strain) that is less pertinent. The prioritization of nephrolithiasis as the primary concern is appropriate, but the inclusion of muscle strain detracts slightly from the overall focus on the most likely causes related to urinary symptoms.

Given this analysis, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings, but the inclusion of muscle strain creates a minor flaw in prioritization.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis- most likely due to acute onset, severe pain with colicky course, history of gout, urinary symptoms, and CVA tenderness on exam 2. Muscle strain- possible due to history of recent increase in activity level, but less likely as it would not explain urinary symptoms or CVA tenderness 3. Pyelonephritis- possible due to urinary symptoms and CVA tenderness on exam, but patient is afebrile and would expect pain to be constant
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis, muscle strain, and pyelonephritis. 

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The rationale is strong as it highlights the acute onset, severe pain, colicky nature, history of gout, and mentions costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness. These are all relevant findings that support this diagnosis.

2. **Muscle strain**: The reasoning here is appropriate, acknowledging the recent increase in activity level, but it correctly identifies that this diagnosis does not explain the urinary symptoms or CVA tenderness. This shows a good understanding of the differential but is less robust compared to nephrolithiasis.

3. **Pyelonephritis**: The explanation is valid as it considers urinary symptoms and CVA tenderness. However, it mentions that the patient is afebrile and anticipates constant pain, which is a reasonable point but somewhat weakens the link to this diagnosis. 

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well supported, with clear links to findings. While there are some minor issues, they do not significantly detract from patient care. 

Given the strengths and weaknesses identified, I would score this a 3.

Response: The plan includes a urinalysis (UA) which is required and appropriate for evaluating microhematuria, suggesting nephrolithiasis. It also includes a renal ultrasound, which is an acceptable test to look for stones and determine their size. However, there are no unnecessary tests included in the plan. 

Overall, the plan is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests (UA and renal ultrasound), and does not include any unnecessary tests.

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Muscle strain 3. Pyelonephritis

Supporting Information:
1. Nephrolithiasis- most likely due to acute onset, severe pain with colicky course, history of gout, urinary symptoms, and CVA tenderness on exam 2. Muscle strain- possible due to history of recent increase in activity level, but less likely as it would not explain urinary symptoms or CVA tenderness 3.

Response: The organization of the provided note is generally clear, with distinct sections for the History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section is labeled appropriately, and the information is presented in a logical order that follows the clinical reasoning process. 

However, there are minor issues that could be improved. For instance, the details in the HPI could be more succinctly organized to avoid some repetition, particularly regarding the urinary symptoms that are mentioned both in the HPI and again in the ROS. The physical examination section is well-structured, but there could be a clearer distinction between normal findings and abnormal findings.

Overall, while most features are organized and presented in appropriate sections, there are some areas of minor disorganization and redundancy.

Based on the rubric criteria, I would score this section as follows:

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: pt is a middle-aged male presenting with acute right flank pain. he reports this pain has occurred for the last 24 hours lasting 2 minutes each time. he describes his pain as sharp, stabbing and points to an area on his right upper back. he also endorses increased urinary urgency and frequency and suprapubic pressure. there is associated nausea and vomiting with his pain which he rates a 9/10 at its worst. ibuprofen has not helped to alleviate the pain. he fears this may be related to his gb due to similar symptoms as his mother. however, denies association with food, bilious vomit, or changes in bowel movements ros: otherwise negative aside from what's stated in HPI pmh: gout controlled with diet; no meds; no allergies psh: none fmh: mom had gb removed
Response: To evaluate the provided history of present illness (HPI) based on the rubric, we can break down the key components that were expected according to the answer key:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does mention "acute right flank pain," which is correct.
2. **Duration**: The patient states the pain has occurred for the last 24 hours, which matches the requirement.
3. **Nature of pain**: The description of the pain as "sharp" is present, but the patient describes it as "stabbing" and does not mention "spasms" or "colic," which are also part of the answer key.
4. **Severity**: The patient rates the pain as 9/10, which is included.
5. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are mentioned, and the patient specifies that the vomit is not bilious, which aligns with the answer key.
6. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient mentions increased urinary urgency and frequency, but does not explicitly mention dysuria.
7. **Hematuria**: The patient denies hematuria, which is an important negative finding that is missing from the HPI.

Overall, while the HPI contains several key elements, it misses some pertinent negatives (such as hematuria) and does not adequately cover the specific details about the nature of the pain (missing "spasms" or "colic"). The organization is somewhat clear, but the presence of some inaccuracies and omissions impacts the overall quality.

Based on the rubric:
- The note has most key positive historical findings documented but is missing some pertinent negatives and specific details.
- The organization is acceptable but not optimal due to some disorganization in the presentation of symptoms.

Therefore, I would assign a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: vitals: t 99.7, hr 85, rr 16, bp 128/82, 99% ra gen: well appearing, as stated age heart: normal rate, rhythm, bilateral tibial pulses 2+ resp: lungs clear; no adventitious sounds gi: good bowel sounds, no abdominal tenderness to palpation, possible mild suprapubic tenderness gu: moderate costovertebral tenderness upon palpation of right flank.
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to analyze the content based on the answer key.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs presented (temperature 99.7, heart rate 85, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 128/82, oxygen saturation 99% on room air) indicate that the vitals are mostly normal, with the temperature being slightly elevated (but not significantly high). Therefore, this does not fully align with the "normal vitals" from the answer key.

2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The findings indicate "moderate costovertebral tenderness upon palpation of right flank," which matches the answer key.

3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note states "no abdominal tenderness to palpation," which matches the answer key.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- The vital signs are not entirely normal due to the slightly elevated temperature.
- The costovertebral angle tenderness is noted correctly.
- Abdominal tenderness is appropriately documented as absent.

Based on the rubric:
- The note includes key findings but is slightly disorganized with the vital signs not being completely normal.
- The positive findings are present, but the slight issue with the vitals may affect the overall score.

Considering these factors, I would score this section a 3, as most key physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but there is a missing element regarding the "normal" status of the vitals.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Pt is a middle-age male with pmh of diet-controlled gout presenting acutely with right flank pain. His examination is significant for mild suprapubic tenderness and right costovertebral pain. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary against the rubric, we first identify the essential elements that should be included based on the answer key.

The answer key includes the following essential elements:
1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2. Right flank pain
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves

Additionally, there are optional elements that could be included:
- Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile.

Now, let's analyze the provided summary:

- The summary mentions "presenting acutely with right flank pain," which covers essential elements 1 and 2.
- However, it does not specify the intensity of the pain (essential element 3 is missing).
- It also does not mention spasms, colic, or that the pain comes in waves (essential element 4 is missing).
- There are no optional elements mentioned.

Now, counting the essential elements:
- Present: 2 (Acute onset, Right flank pain)
- Missing: 2 (Intensity, Spasms/colic/waves)

According to the rubric:
- The summary is missing multiple essential elements.

Based on this evaluation, the score would be 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. kidney stone, nephrolithiasis 2/2 to uncontrolled gout 2. pyelonephritis 3. cystitis 2/2 urolithiasis
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, let's analyze the components based on the rubric:

1. The first item listed is "kidney stone, nephrolithiasis," which aligns well with the answer key. However, "uncontrolled gout" is not mentioned in the answer key and does not correlate with the symptoms typically associated with nephrolithiasis. This introduces a minor inconsistency.

2. The second item, "pyelonephritis," is consistent with the answer key.

3. The third item, "cystitis," is somewhat related to urinary tract infections but is not explicitly listed in the answer key. However, it does reflect a reasonable consideration given the context of urinary symptoms.

4. The mention of "urolithiasis" is essentially synonymous with nephrolithiasis and reinforces the first point.

Overall, the differential diagnosis presented is generally consistent with the findings, but the inclusion of "uncontrolled gout" introduces a significant flaw in prioritization. The other components are reasonable, but the overall inconsistency with the findings suggests a need for improvement.

Based on this analysis, I would score this differential diagnosis as a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. hx of gout only controlled via diet, positive costovertebral tenderness, mildly febrile with t of 99.7, acute presentation of flank pain, increased urinary urge and frequency 2. pyelonephritis - possible due to presentation of costovertebral tenderness, mild fever, and increased urge and frequency. however, would expect presentation to be much worse with a higher fever, worsening uti symptoms, and history of recurrent uti 3. likely given presentation and associated symptoms of increased urge and frequency. less likely given history of flank pain
Response: Let's analyze the provided differential diagnosis support based on the rubric criteria.

1. The student mentions a history of gout which could suggest nephrolithiasis but they also provide positive costovertebral tenderness and mild fever, which are more indicative of a urinary tract infection (UTI) or pyelonephritis. They mention acute flank pain and increased urinary urge and frequency, which aligns with UTI/pyelonephritis.

2. The student correctly identifies pyelonephritis as a possibility due to the presentation of costovertebral tenderness, mild fever, and increased urge and frequency. However, they note that the expected presentation would usually be worse, indicating some understanding of the disease process and its typical presentation.

3. The student expresses uncertainty regarding the likelihood of pyelonephritis due to the history of flank pain, which shows they are considering the full clinical picture.

The differential diagnosis is reasonably well-supported, with links to the diagnoses being mostly correct. However, there are some inaccuracies and a lack of complete links (e.g., not fully addressing the implications of the history of gout in relation to nephrolithiasis). 

Overall, the student has provided a logical differential diagnosis but with some missing or incorrect links that would not significantly impact patient care.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. UA and Urine culture 2. renal u/s 3. CBC, CMP for possible infection 4. will consider ct abd/pelvis if U/S unremarkable 5. recommend adequate po fluid intake 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup based on the rubric:

1. The required test, UA, is included.
2. The plan includes a renal ultrasound, which is acceptable.
3. The CBC and CMP can be considered relevant for assessing possible infection, but they are not specifically listed as essential tests in the answer key.
4. The plan mentions considering a CT abdomen/pelvis if the ultrasound is unremarkable, which is reasonable.
5. The recommendation for adequate oral fluid intake is appropriate but not a diagnostic test.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and an acceptable renal ultrasound. However, it includes CBC and CMP, which are not listed as essential in the answer key, making it more than just the necessary tests. The inclusion of some unnecessary tests (CBC and CMP) weighs against the effectiveness of the plan.

Given this assessment, the plan is reasonable but includes some unnecessary tests, leading to a score of 3.

Response: The provided note is fairly organized, with distinct sections for the History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section is labeled and contains relevant information pertaining to the patient's condition.

1. **History of Present Illness (HPI)**: This section is detailed and clearly outlines the patient's symptoms, duration, and associated factors. It is well-structured and provides a comprehensive view of the patient's presenting issue.

2. **Physical Examination**: This section is also well-organized, listing vital signs and findings in a systematic manner. The use of headings for different systems (general, heart, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary) enhances clarity.

3. **Summary**: The summary succinctly encapsulates the key points from the HPI and physical examination, reinforcing the main issues at hand.

4. **Differential Diagnosis**: This section lists potential diagnoses in a clear manner, providing a rationale for each, which is beneficial for understanding the clinical reasoning.

5. **Supporting Information**: This section effectively supports the differential diagnosis with relevant details from the history and examination findings.

6. **Plan**: The plan is clearly delineated, outlining specific tests and recommendations, which is essential for follow-up care.

Overall, the note is logically structured, with all necessary sections present and information appropriately categorized. There are no major issues with disorganization or missing sections.

Given the rubric's scoring criteria, this note would fall under the "4" category, as all features are organized, with information presented in appropriate sections.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI: Mr. Ryan is a middle-aged male presenting to the ED with right-sided abdominal pain since yesterday morning. He reports the pain is constant and dull, with occasional episodes of sharp pain that sometimes radiates to his groin. The sharp pains have lead to nausea and vomiting twice. Tylenol has not relived his pain. He reports the sharp pain comes at random and is not worsened by any factors. He has also has 2 episodes of burning with urination, but denies any blood in his urine. He also went to the gym 3 days ago and did more rowing than usual. He denies fevers or changes in bowel habits. He has never had an episode like this before. PMH: 1 episode of gout 2 years ago that resolved with medication. No daily meds. No surgeries. Sprained ankle in high school. FH: Mother had gallstones with cholecystectomy and father had diabetes. SH: Sedentary job. Denies smoking and drugs use. Alcohol approximately 1x a month. ROS: denies changes in vision, changes in sleep, difficulties hearing, chest pain, racing heart, shortness of breath, stomach pain (other than HPI), difficulties stooling, difficulties urination (other than HPI), joint pain, abnormal rashes or bruising, depression and anxiety. 
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI against the rubric, we can identify several key points:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does report right-sided abdominal pain, which is a relevant detail.
2. **Duration**: The HPI specifies "since yesterday morning," which indicates a time frame but does not explicitly state "24 hours" or "acute."
3. **Character of pain**: The patient describes the pain as "constant and dull," with "occasional episodes of sharp pain." The description lacks the required terminology of "sharp," "spasms," or "colic."
4. **Severity**: The severity of the pain is not quantified; the patient does not provide a pain scale rating (e.g., 9/10).
5. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are present, and the HPI states that the vomiting is "twice" and "nonbloody/nonbilious," which is acceptable. However, the HPI does not specify the nature of the vomiting clearly as per the rubric.
6. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient reports burning with urination but does not mention urgency, and he denies hematuria, which is correctly documented.
7. **Additional context**: The patient provides some context about recent activities (going to the gym), which could be relevant but is somewhat extraneous in the context of the HPI.

Overall, while the HPI includes some relevant information, it misses several key points from the rubric, such as the precise description of the pain, severity rating, and full clarity on the vomiting. The organization is decent, but the omission of key historical findings and the lack of conciseness lead to a lower score.

Based on this assessment, I would assign a score of 2.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Temp 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 Oxygen 99% on RA Constitutional: Awake, alert, and oriented x3. HEENT: EOM intact. PERRL. Neck: No lymphadenopathy. CV: Normal s1 and s2. No murmurs appreciated. No lower extremity edema. Posterior tibial pulses 2+. Lungs: clear to ascultation bilaterally. Abdomen: No point tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds present. CVA tenderness to palpation at right flank. Neuro: UE strength 5/5 b/l. LE strength 5/5 b/l. Normal gait. MSK: no tenderness to palpation of thoracic or lumbar spine or paraspinal muscles. Normal range of motion of lumbar spine. 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, let's analyze the information step-by-step.

1. **Key Physical Exam Findings**: The note includes normal vital signs, which align with the key findings in the answer key. However, it also includes additional information that may not be strictly necessary for the context of the patient's symptoms.

2. **Positive Findings**: The note mentions positive costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness, which is a key finding that aligns with the answer key. 

3. **Negative Findings**: The note states "No abdominal tenderness," which is a pertinent negative that is included in the answer key.

4. **Organization and Conciseness**: The findings are generally well organized, but the additional details (e.g., the complete neurological exam, musculoskeletal exam, etc.) may be considered excessive for the context of the interview, potentially obscuring the key findings.

Based on this evaluation:
- The key physical exam findings are mostly present.
- The organization is good, but the level of detail may detract from conciseness.
- The pertinent negatives are included.

Considering these points, I would assign a score of 3 for this section, as most key positive findings are documented and organized well, but it misses the mark on conciseness due to the inclusion of excessive detail.

3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle-aged male presenting with 1 day of colicky right flank pain with radiation to his groin and associated dysuria. 
Response: To evaluate the provided note against the rubric, we will identify the essential elements mentioned in the answer key and check if they are present in the statement.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The note states "1 day," which indicates acute onset.
2. **Right flank pain**: The note mentions "right flank pain."
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not specified, so this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The note includes "colicky," which addresses this element.
5. **Optional elements**: The note mentions "dysuria," which is not included in the optional elements provided in the answer key.

Now summarizing the findings:
- Essential elements present: 1 (acute onset), 2 (right flank pain), 4 (colicky pain).
- Missing essential element: 3 (intensity of pain).
- The note includes 4 total elements (including the optional element).

According to the rubric:
- The statement is missing 1 essential element (intensity of pain) and has 4 total elements, which is within the limit of 5.

Therefore, the score for this section is a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1.) Nephrolithiasis 2.) Lumbar strain
Response: In evaluating the differential diagnosis provided, we see that "Nephrolithiasis" is included, which aligns correctly with the findings of the patient interview, as it is a common cause of renal colic symptoms. However, "Lumbar strain" is not as relevant to the findings described in the answer key, which focuses on renal issues such as UTI or pyelonephritis. 

The differential diagnosis is partially consistent with the findings, but the inclusion of "Lumbar strain" introduces a flaw in prioritization. It does not accurately reflect the most relevant conditions based on the patient's symptoms. Therefore, while one of the diagnoses is appropriate, the second is not, leading to a somewhat broad and inaccurately prioritized differential diagnosis.

Based on the rubric, this would be scored as a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1.) Nephrolithiasis - this is most likely diagnosis given the nature of the symptoms. Colicky right flank pain with radiation to his groin with associated dysuria. This is supported by his previous episode of gout, which indicates that he could have difficulties with oxalate excretion. However, his recent history of rowing supports the alternative diagnosis. 2.) Lumbar strain - he has a sedentary lifestyle and recently did significantly more exercise than usual specifically targeting his back muscles (rowing). However, I would expect this pain to worsen with movement instead of at random. I would also no expect this to cause dysuria. 
Response: The differential diagnosis presented includes nephrolithiasis and lumbar strain, with a focus on the symptoms and history provided. 

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The student identifies nephrolithiasis as the most likely diagnosis, which aligns with the acute, colicky right flank pain and associated symptoms. They correctly link the patient's history of gout to potential difficulties with oxalate excretion, which is a relevant connection. However, they incorrectly mention dysuria as a symptom associated with nephrolithiasis, which is not typically a presenting symptom unless there is a concurrent urinary tract infection. This misinterpretation does weaken the support for this diagnosis slightly. 

2. **Lumbar strain**: The student provides a reasonable rationale for considering lumbar strain, linking it to the recent increase in physical activity. They also correctly note that lumbar strain typically would not cause dysuria, which is a pertinent consideration.

Overall, while the student has made an effort to support their differential diagnoses, there are some inaccuracies and misinterpretations, particularly with the inclusion of dysuria for nephrolithiasis. The links to the diagnoses are partially correct but contain some critical errors that could impact patient care.

Given these considerations, I would rate this section as a score of 3, as the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported, but includes some missing or incorrect links that are significant but not detrimental to patient care.

2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Abdominal CT scan
Response: The plan provided includes an abdominal CT scan, which is an acceptable test according to the rubric. However, it does not include the required urinalysis (UA) or any other essential tests. Since it is missing the required test and does not include other acceptable tests, this plan is ineffective and essential tests are missed. Therefore, it fits the description of scoring a 2.

HPI: Mr. Ryan is a middle-aged male presenting to the ED with right-sided abdominal pain since yesterday morning. He reports the pain is constant and dull, with occasional episodes of sharp pain that sometimes radiates to his groin. The sharp pains have lead to nausea and vomiting twice. Tylenol has not relived his pain. He reports the sharp pain comes at random and is not worsened by any factors. He has also has 2 episodes of burning with urination, but denies any blood in his urine. He also went to the gym 3 days ago and did more rowing than usual. He denies fevers or changes in bowel habits. He has never had an episode like this before. PMH: 1 episode of gout 2 years ago that resolved with medication. No daily meds. No surgeries. Sprained ankle in high school. FH: Mother had gallstones with cholecystectomy and father had diabetes. SH: Sedentary job. Denies smoking and drugs use. Alcohol approximately 1x a month. ROS: denies changes in vision, changes in sleep, difficulties hearing, chest pain, racing heart, shortness of breath, stomach pain (other than HPI), difficulties stooling, difficulties urination (other than HPI), joint pain, abnormal rashes or bruising, depression and anxiety. 

Physical Examination:

No lower extremity edema. Posterior tibial pulses 2+. Lungs: clear to ascultation bilaterally. Abdomen: No point tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds present. CVA tenderness to palpation at right flank. Neuro: UE strength 5/5 b/l. LE strength 5/5 b/l. Normal gait. MSK: no tenderness to palpation of thoracic or lumbar spine or paraspinal muscles. Normal range of motion of lumbar spine. 

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a middle-aged male presenting with 1 day of colicky right flank pain with radiation to his groin and associated dysuria. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1.) Nephrolithiasis 2.) Lumbar strain

Supporting Information:
1.) Nephrolithiasis - this is most likely diagnosis given the nature of the symptoms. Colicky right flank pain with radiation to his groin with associated dysuria. This is supported by his previous episode of gout, which indicates that he could have difficulties with oxalate excretion. However, his recent history of rowing supports the alternative diagnosis. 2.) Lumbar strain - he has a sedentary lifestyle and recently did significantly more exercise than usual specifically targeting his back muscles (rowing). However, I would expect this pain to worsen with movement instead of at random. I would also no expect this to cause dysuria. 

Plan:
Abdominal CT scan


Response: The organization of the provided note is quite clear and follows a logical structure, with distinct sections for History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section contains relevant information pertaining to the patient's case, and there is no significant repetition or missing components.

1. **History of Present Illness (HPI)**: The HPI is comprehensive and well-structured, detailing the patient's symptoms, their duration, and associated factors.
2. **Physical Examination**: This section is organized and presents findings in a systematic manner, separating different body systems clearly.
3. **Summary**: This succinctly encapsulates the main issues at hand.
4. **Differential Diagnosis**: The differential is clearly stated and follows logically from the information provided.
5. **Supporting Information**: This section effectively ties the symptoms and history to the differential diagnoses.
6. **Plan**: The plan is straightforward and directly relevant to the issues presented.

Overall, the note is organized effectively, with all necessary features present in appropriate sections. Thus, I would assign a score of 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 60 year old male who presents to the ED with a chief complaint of 1 day of right sided flank pain. Mr. Ryan reports that these symptoms started yesterday which he describes as right side pain that travels down his groin. He states that he maintains a baseline level of pain, but that approximately every 1-2 hours, he will have a "spasm" where the pain will intensify and it will last for 2-20 minutes. He reports that during the past day, he has also had pain with urination and increased urinary frequency. He reports that the pain is so intense that he will have nausea and vomiting with the spasms. He reports that this has never happened before. He tried taking Tylenol, but reports that it did not alleviate his symptoms. A 14-point review of systems was performed. Pertinent positives include right-sided flank pain, dysuria, nausea, and vomiting. Pertinent negatives include fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, hematuria, headache, lightheadedness. He has no chronic medical conditions. He reports that 2 years ago he had an episode of gout that was treated and has not recurred. He takes no medications daily. He has no allergies. He has no history of surgeries. Family history is notable for gallstones in his mother. He does not endorse the use of tobacco products, alcohol, or other drugs. He reports no new sexual partners. 
Response: In evaluating the provided history of present illness (HPI), we can assess the key components against the rubric criteria:

1. **Right flank pain** - The patient clearly identifies the location of the pain as right-sided flank pain.
2. **Duration** - The patient states the symptoms started "yesterday," which aligns with the requirement of 24 hours or acute.
3. **Description of pain** - The patient describes the pain as sharp and mentions "spasms" occurring every 1-2 hours, which meets the requirement for pain description.
4. **Severity** - The intensity of the pain is described as severe, but the patient does not provide a specific rating (like 9/10) which is a minor omission.
5. **Nausea and vomiting** - The patient reports nausea and vomiting, specifying that it is clear and non-bloody/non-bilious, which meets the criteria.
6. **Dysuria and/or urgency** - The patient reports pain with urination and increased urinary frequency, fulfilling this requirement.
7. **No hematuria** - The patient does not report hematuria, which is a pertinent negative that is included.

Overall, the HPI is mostly complete and well-organized, with only a minor omission regarding the exact pain severity rating. However, it captures almost all key information in a concise manner without irrelevant details.

Given this assessment, I would score this section as a 4, as it meets the criteria of having almost all key information present, concise, and well organized with little irrelevant information.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: T 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 O2 99% on RA GEN: Well-appearing male of stated age. He looks uncomfortable on exam. He is alert and oriented. Eyes: PERRLA, EOM intact. Conjunctiva no injected. No scleral icterus. HENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic head. Mucus membranes moist. No dental abnormalities appreciated. No palpable cervical lymph nodes. Resp: No acute respiratory distress. No tachypnea. Breath sounds even bilaterally. No restricted air movement. No nasal flairing or retractions. Cardio: Heart sounds auscultated x4. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No extra heart sounds. Distal pulses 2+, no peripheral edema. Abd: Soft, non-distended, nontender to light and deep palpation. Liver not palpable on exam. No dullness to percussion. Bowel sounds appreciated. Back: No spinal tenderness. No paraspinal tenderness. Right-sided CVAT present, absent on left. Neuro: BUE, BLE 5/5 strength. Gait normal. Awake, alert, and oriented. 
Response: In evaluating the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we can identify the following:

1. **Key Physical Exam Findings**: The note includes normal vital signs which are essential, and it documents the presence of positive costovertebral angle tenderness on the right side, which is a key finding. However, the note does not explicitly mention the absence of abdominal tenderness, which is a pertinent negative that should have been included.

2. **Organization and Conciseness**: The findings are generally well organized and presented in a systematic manner, covering various systems (general, eyes, HENT, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal, back, and neurological). There is little irrelevant information included.

3. **Omissions**: While most key findings are documented, the lack of mention regarding the absence of abdominal tenderness is significant. 

Based on the rubric:
- The note includes almost all key physical exam findings and is organized well, but it is missing a pertinent negative (abdominal tenderness). Therefore, it does not meet the highest criteria of including "almost all key physical exam findings" since it lacks the pertinent negative.

Given these points, the score for this section would be a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Nathaniel Ryan is a 60 year old male who presents today with 1 day of right-sided flank pain and dysuria with right-sided CVAT noted on exam. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary based on the rubric, we need to identify whether all essential elements are present and how many total elements are included.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The note states "1 day of right-sided flank pain," which indicates an acute onset within the past 24 hours. This element is present.
2. **Right flank pain**: The note mentions "right-sided flank pain." This element is present.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not specified in the note. This essential element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The note does not mention any spasms, colic, or waves of pain. This essential element is missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The note mentions "dysuria," which is not listed in the optional elements. However, it does not include any of the optional elements presented in the rubric.

Now, let's tally the findings:
- Essential elements present: 2 (acute onset, right flank pain)
- Essential elements missing: 2 (intensity, spasms/colic)
- Total elements reported: 2 (only the essential elements counted, as no optional elements are included)

According to the rubric:
- Missing multiple essential elements (2 missing).
- The summary does not include a total of 5 or fewer elements since it only includes 2.

Therefore, the score for this section is 2.

2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Right nephrolithiasis 2. Urinary tract infection
Response: The provided differential diagnoses include "Right nephrolithiasis" and "Urinary tract infection." 

1. The primary diagnosis of "Right nephrolithiasis" aligns well with the findings, especially if the symptoms indicated renal colic or related pain.
2. The secondary diagnosis of "Urinary tract infection" is also consistent, as UTIs can present with similar symptoms, particularly if there is urinary frequency, urgency, or dysuria.

The differential diagnoses are pertinent and prioritized correctly, reflecting a good interpretation of the findings. There are no significant flaws in the prioritization that would impact patient care negatively, as both conditions are common and relevant based on typical presentations.

Based on the rubric, this would score a 4.

Right nephrolithiasis - Supports: Unilateral flank pain with radiation to the groin, pain intense enough to elicit nausea and vomiting, dysuria - Absence of hematuria 2. Urinary tract infection - Supports: Dysuria with no gross hematuria - Refutes: Unilateral nature, location of pain, quality of the pain, lack of system symptoms like fever. 
Response: In evaluating the differential diagnosis provided, we can analyze the support for each diagnosis based on the criteria in the rubric.

1. **Right Nephrolithiasis**: 
   - The support mentions unilateral flank pain, which aligns well with the presenting symptom of right flank pain. 
   - The pain is described as intense enough to elicit nausea and vomiting, which is consistent with renal colic. 
   - However, the support incorrectly includes dysuria, which is not typically associated with nephrolithiasis unless there is a urinary tract infection present, and it mentions the absence of hematuria, which is often found in cases of nephrolithiasis.
   - Overall, while there are some strong links, the incorrect inclusion of dysuria and absence of hematuria weakens the support.

2. **Urinary Tract Infection**:
   - The support states dysuria, which is a correct symptom for UTI. However, it refutes the unilateral nature and quality of pain, which are critical in differentiating between UTI and nephrolithiasis.
   - The mention of the absence of systemic symptoms like fever is also relevant, as this would further support the diagnosis of UTI being less likely.
   - The reasoning here is somewhat strong in terms of refuting UTI as a diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported for nephrolithiasis but has significant flaws due to the inclusion of dysuria and the absence of hematuria. The UTI diagnosis is refuted effectively but lacks comprehensive support.

Given the overall evaluation, I would score this section as a 2, as it presents a weakly supported differential diagnosis with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis.

2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Initial workup I would like to complete include a U/A to assess for hematuria, leukocytes, and nitrites which will help in establishing a diagnosis of either nephrolithiasis or UTI. I would like to do a right renal US to evaluate for stones. While patient remains in the ED, I would like to start him on fluids to help with hydration, which can help pass a stone. I would also like to start oxycodone prn for pain while workup is being completed. 
Response: The plan includes a urinalysis (UA), which is essential for assessing potential hematuria, leukocytes, and nitrites, thereby addressing the patient's symptoms effectively. The inclusion of a right renal ultrasound is also appropriate for evaluating nephrolithiasis, which is relevant to the patient's presentation. Starting fluids for hydration and prescribing oxycodone for pain management are reasonable supportive measures while the workup is ongoing.

However, the plan does not include a BMP or a CT abdomen/pelvis, which could also be considered essential tests for a comprehensive evaluation in this context. There are no unnecessary tests mentioned in the provided plan.

Overall, the plan is reasonable but lacks some essential tests that would make it more comprehensive. Therefore, it falls short of being fully effective and efficient.

No scleral icterus. HENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic head. Mucus membranes moist. No dental abnormalities appreciated. No palpable cervical lymph nodes. Resp: No acute respiratory distress. No tachypnea. Breath sounds even bilaterally. No restricted air movement. No nasal flairing or retractions. Cardio: Heart sounds auscultated x4. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No extra heart sounds. Distal pulses 2+, no peripheral edema. Abd: Soft, non-distended, nontender to light and deep palpation. Liver not palpable on exam. No dullness to percussion. Bowel sounds appreciated. Back: No spinal tenderness. No paraspinal tenderness. Right-sided CVAT present, absent on left. Neuro: BUE, BLE 5/5 strength. Gait normal. Awake, alert, and oriented. 

Summary:
Mr. Nathaniel Ryan is a 60 year old male who presents today with 1 day of right-sided flank pain and dysuria with right-sided CVAT noted on exam. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Right nephrolithiasis 2. Urinary tract infection

Supporting Information:
1. Right nephrolithiasis - Supports: Unilateral flank pain with radiation to the groin, pain intense enough to elicit nausea and vomiting, dysuria - Absence of hematuria 2. Urinary tract infection - Supports: Dysuria with no gross hematuria - Refutes: Unilateral nature, location of pain, quality of the pain, lack of system symptoms like fever. 

Plan:
Initial workup I would like to complete include a U/A to assess for hematuria, leukocytes, and nitrites which will help in establishing a diagnosis of either nephrolithiasis or UTI. I would like to do a right renal US to evaluate for stones. While patient remains in the ED, I would like to start him on fluids to help with hydration, which can help pass a stone. I would also like to start oxycodone prn for pain while workup is being completed. 


Response: The organization of the provided post-interview note is quite structured, with clear sections that delineate the History of Present Illness, Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section is appropriately labeled and contains relevant information related to the patient's symptoms and medical history. The flow of information is logical, and there are no apparent repetitions or misplaced details.

Given that all features are organized and information is presented in appropriate sections, I would assign a score of 4.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 49 year old male with a history of gout who presents with 24 hours of intermittent right sided flank pain. Patient stated that his pain has been sharp and associated with a couple episodes of emesis, and he states that it occasionally radiates to his groin. Patient has tried ibuprofen for pain, but it has not helped and he has been unable to identify any other alleviating factors. There are no aggravating factors, as patient states pain comes on randomly. Patient noted that he has recently had increased urinary urgency, but has not noticed any gross hematuria. Patient has never had symptoms like this before, but states that he is worried about gallstones because his mother had to have her gallbladder removed. Patient denied fever and chills. ROS negative except as noted in HPI PMH: gout treated with diet Medications: none Family history: mother with gallstones Surgical History: tonsillectomy as a child Social: lives in Georgetown with his wife, works outside the home. Denies alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. 
Response: The provided HPI includes several key elements that align with the rubric. 

1. The description of the flank pain is present, noting it as right-sided, sharp, and intermittent over the past 24 hours, which is aligned with the acute nature of the pain.
2. The patient reports severe pain (though it does not quantify it as 9/10) and mentions episodes of emesis, which indicates nausea and vomiting. However, it lacks the specificity of the emesis being clear or nonbloody/nonbilious.
3. The patient mentions increased urinary urgency and denies gross hematuria, which is a relevant detail.
4. While the HPI is mostly organized, it includes some irrelevant information about the patient's family history and social history that does not directly pertain to the acute symptoms being evaluated.

Overall, most of the key historical findings are documented, but there are some pertinent negatives missing (specifically the severity of pain and the nature of the emesis). Therefore, while the note is generally well organized, it could be improved with more specific details.

Based on the rubric, this would fall under a score of 3 as most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, but it is missing some pertinent details.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vital signs: BP 128/82, HR 85, RR 16, O2 99% on RA, T 99.7 General: normal appearing male in no acute distress, well developed and well nourished HEENT: dentition normal. Mucus membranes moist. No lesions in oropharynx. Neck: no cervical lymphadenopathy CV: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs noted. No lower extremity edema. Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ and symmetric Resp: lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no respiratory distress or accessory muscle use GI: abdomen soft, non-tender, nondistended. No hernias noted. Bowel sounds present. GU: Right sided costovertebral angle tenderness present Neuro: EOM intact. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. 5/5 strength in bilateral proximal and distal upper and lower extremities. Gait normal. 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric criteria:

1. **Key Physical Exam Findings**: The answer key indicates that normal vitals and positive costovertebral angle tenderness are key findings. The provided physical exam does include normal vital signs and mentions right-sided costovertebral angle tenderness, which is a positive finding.

2. **Conciseness and Organization**: The physical exam findings are presented in a well-organized manner, categorized by systems (General, HEENT, Neck, CV, Resp, GI, GU, Neuro), which aids clarity. 

3. **Missing Pertinent Negatives**: While the positive findings are documented, the rubric specifies that pertinent negatives should also be included. In this case, while abdominal tenderness is noted as absent, the documentation could be improved by explicitly stating it as a negative finding, which would enhance completeness.

4. **Irrelevant Information**: The physical exam is detailed but does not appear to include irrelevant information that obscures key findings. 

In summary, the documentation includes almost all key findings but lacks explicit mention of some pertinent negatives, specifically the lack of abdominal tenderness. Therefore, it meets most criteria but falls short in completeness.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 3.

Response: Let's evaluate the provided sum based on the rubric and the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "24 hours of right sided flank pain," which indicates the time frame. This element is present.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement specifies "right sided flank pain," which meets this criterion. This element is present.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The statement does not provide an intensity rating. This element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement does not mention spasms, colic, or waves of pain. This element is missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement does not include non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, or afebrile status. These are optional and not required for scoring.

Based on the evaluation:
- Two essential elements are missing (intensity and spasms/colic).
- The total number of elements reported is 3.

According to the rubric:
- Missing multiple essential elements = 2 points.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2: Pyelonephritis 
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes "Nephrolithiasis" and "Pyelonephritis." 

1. "Nephrolithiasis" is indeed a relevant diagnosis given the context of the patient's symptoms, likely indicating kidney stones.
2. "Pyelonephritis" is also a pertinent diagnosis, as it is a possible complication of a urinary tract infection that could present with similar symptoms.

However, the second diagnosis is listed as "Pyelonephritis" without the "UTI" context that would typically precede it, which could imply a lack of clarity regarding the progression of the condition. The prioritization is correct, but it could benefit from the inclusion of UTI to show a more comprehensive understanding of the differential.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings and reflects a reasonable prioritization, though it is somewhat lacking in completeness regarding the UTI context.

Based on the rubric, I would score this a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1: Nephrolithiasis is the most likely diagnosis due to the presence of unilateral flank pain which is intermittent and sharp in nature and associated with recent onset of urinary urgency. There is also radiation to the groin which is consistent with nephrolithiasis. Patient exhibited exquisite right sided costovertebral angle tenderness which also supports this diagnosis, but could also be secondary to pyelonephritis. 2: pyelonephritis: this is possible due to presence of severe costovertebral angle tenderness on exam and recent onset of urinary urgency, however I would also expect more urinary symptoms and presence of fever or chills which this patient did not have. 
Response: The provided differential diagnosis shows a solid understanding of the potential conditions based on the symptoms described. The student identifies nephrolithiasis as the most likely diagnosis and provides relevant supporting details, such as the nature of the flank pain and the costovertebral angle tenderness. They also correctly mention pyelonephritis as a possible differential and acknowledge the lack of additional urinary symptoms and fever/chills, which is a thoughtful consideration.

However, while the main diagnosis is well-supported, the links to pyelonephritis could be considered slightly less robust, given the absence of certain symptoms that would typically accompany that diagnosis. The reasoning is sound, but there is a slight gap in the completeness of the differential diagnosis, particularly regarding the other potential diagnoses like muscle strain and inguinal hernia, which were not mentioned.

Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the differential diagnosis process, but there are some weaknesses in completeness and links to all potential diagnoses.

Based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 3 for this section.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score:  -@non-@contrast CT abdomen and pelvis -@CBC -@CMP -@urinalysis and urine culture
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we can break down the components based on the rubric:

1. **Required Test**: The plan includes a urinalysis (UA), which is essential and required.
2. **Acceptable Tests**: The plan includes a non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which is an acceptable test. However, it also includes a CBC (Complete Blood Count) and CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel), which are not listed as acceptable or required in the answer key.
3. **Unacceptable Tests**: There are no unacceptable tests included in the plan.

Now, assessing the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the plan:
- It includes the essential test (UA).
- It adds a non-contrast CT, which is acceptable.
- However, the inclusion of CBC and CMP may be considered unnecessary since they are not part of the essential or acceptable tests in the answer key.

Given that the plan includes all essential tests but also includes some unnecessary tests, it aligns with the criteria for a score of 3.

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a 49 year old male with a history of gout who presents with 24 hours of right sided flank pain which radiates to the groin and with associated CVAT. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Nephrolithiasis 2: Pyelonephritis 

Supporting Information:
1: Nephrolithiasis is the most likely diagnosis due to the presence of unilateral flank pain which is intermittent and sharp in nature and associated with recent onset of urinary urgency. There is also radiation to the groin which is consistent with nephrolithiasis. Patient exhibited exquisite right sided costovertebral angle tenderness which also supports this diagnosis, but could also be secondary to pyelonephritis. 2: pyelonephritis: this is possible due to presence of severe costovertebral angle tenderness on exam and recent onset of urinary urgency, however I would also expect more urinary symptoms and presence of fever or chills which this patient did not have.

Response: The organization of the provided note is generally clear and follows the structure expected in a clinical note. Each section is distinctly labeled, and the information is presented in an orderly manner. The History of Present Illness (HPI) is detailed and provides a coherent narrative of the patient's symptoms. The Physical Examination section is well-organized with clear headings for each system examined, and findings are presented in a logical order. The Summary provides a concise overview of the patient's condition, and the Differential Diagnosis is clearly articulated with supporting information for each potential diagnosis. 

However, there is some inconsistency with the Plan section, where it appears the formatting with "@" symbols may indicate an error or miscommunication in how the plan items are presented. This could be seen as a minor disorganization.

Overall, the note is mostly organized with appropriate sections, but the minor issues with the Plan section prevent it from being fully organized.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as follows:

3) Most features are organized with information presented in appropriate sections.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: R flank pain that began yesterday. Intermittent pain that comes and goes, radiates toward groin. He describes it as spasms. Associated with Urgency and burning when urinating. Also associated with nausea and vomiting. Has tried Tylenol without relief. Nothing makes the pain better or worse Rates pain as 9/10 at its worse. Patient is worried about gallstones as mother has a history. ROS: No Fever, chills, constipation, diarrhea, change in appetite PMH: Gout flare 2 years ago PSH: none FH: Mom - cholecystitis with cholecystectomy Dad- Diabetes, HTN SH: Denies smoking, drug use, drinks 1x per month Meds: none Allergies: None
Response: Let's break down the provided history of present illness (HPI) against the rubric criteria:

1. **Key Information Present**: 
   - The patient has right flank pain that started yesterday, which is acute (meets the first point).
   - The pain is described as spasms and is rated as 9/10 at its worst (both severity and quality are documented).
   - The pain is intermittent and radiates toward the groin, which adds detail but deviates slightly from the concise description of "spasms" alone.
   - Associated symptoms include nausea and vomiting, which are documented as clear and nonbloody/nonbilious (though the clarity of the vomit is not explicitly stated in the HPI).
   - Urgency and burning when urinating are noted, which is relevant to dysuria but the term "dysuria" itself is not used, and there is no mention of hematuria.

2. **Organization and Conciseness**:
   - The information is mostly well organized, but there is some slight deviation from the specific wording of the answer key (e.g., "dysuria" is not explicitly mentioned).
   - The mention of the patient's concern about gallstones and family history, while relevant, adds a layer of detail that could be considered slightly irrelevant to the immediate symptoms.

3. **Missing Pertinent Negatives**:
   - The HPI does not explicitly mention any key negatives such as the absence of hematuria, which is a pertinent negative in this context.

Overall, the HPI includes most of the key information but lacks some specific terminology and misses a pertinent negative. The organization is decent, but the inclusion of extra details may detract from conciseness.

Based on this analysis, I would score this HPI as a 3 because it contains most key positive historical findings and is fairly well organized, but it is missing some pertinent negatives and could be slightly more concise.

2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp: 99.7 HR: 85 RR: 16 BP: 128/82 O2: 99% on RA Moist mucus membranes, no lesions in mouth, good dentition Lymph: No cervical lymphadenopathy Resp: CTAB Cardio: RRR, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops, no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulse Abd: No lesions, bruising or rashes, bowel sounds present, No pain to palpation, negative murphy sign GU: Costovertebral angle significantly tender on percussion Neuro: PERRL, EOMI, 5/5 UE and LE strength, gait normal 
Response: The provided physical exam findings include normal vital signs, which are documented clearly. However, while there is a positive finding of costovertebral angle tenderness, the note lacks documentation of pertinent negatives, such as abdominal tenderness, which is essential to provide a complete picture. The organization of the findings is relatively clear, but the inclusion of irrelevant details (such as "no lesions, bruising or rashes" in the abdomen section) could detract from the focus on key findings.

Given that almost all key physical exam findings are present and organized, but missing some pertinent negatives, I would score this section as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 40 yo male with a history of gout who presents for acute onset intermittent R flank pain that radiates toward to groin that is associated nausea, vomiting and burning and urgency when urinating. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric:

1. The statement mentions "acute onset" – this meets the first essential element.
2. It specifies "R flank pain" – this meets the second essential element.
3. The intensity of the pain is not specified as "10/10" or "severe" – this is a missing essential element.
4. The description of pain as "intermittent" does not meet the requirement for spasms, colic, or pain coming in waves – this is another missing essential element.

Additionally, the statement includes nausea and vomiting, which are optional elements, but does not mention the intensity of pain or how it presents (i.e., spasms or waves). 

Since the summary is missing multiple essential elements (specifically the intensity of pain and the nature of the pain), it fits the criteria for a score of 2.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. Both of these conditions are relevant to the symptoms typically associated with renal issues, such as flank pain or urinary symptoms, which are likely findings based on the patient interview context. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is a direct match for potential kidney stone symptoms, which aligns well with typical presentations.
2. Pyelonephritis is also a relevant diagnosis, particularly if there are urinary tract symptoms or signs of infection.

The differential diagnosis is prioritized correctly, focusing on the most likely causes of the symptoms based on the findings. There are no apparent flaws in this prioritization that would negatively impact patient care.

Given this analysis, I would score this differential diagnosis as a 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis - spasming R flank pain that comes and goes, associated with burning and urgency when urinating, also associated with nausea and vomiting, patient has history of gout, costovertebral angle tenderness 2. Pyelonephritis - costovertebral angle tenderness, burning and urgency when urinating, but does not have fever or chills so I do not have a high suspicion for kidney infection 
Response: The differential diagnosis presented includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis, which are both relevant to the symptoms described. 

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The student notes "spasming R flank pain that comes and goes," which aligns well with the acute, sharp, intermittent nature of nephrolithiasis pain. They also mention "burning and urgency when urinating," which is typically associated with urinary tract issues, but not specifically with nephrolithiasis alone. The mention of nausea and vomiting supports this diagnosis, and the patient's history of gout is a relevant factor. However, the inclusion of costovertebral angle tenderness is more indicative of pyelonephritis rather than nephrolithiasis.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: The student correctly identifies costovertebral angle tenderness as a supporting finding. However, they also note the absence of fever or chills, which is important in ruling out a high suspicion for a kidney infection. The symptoms of burning and urgency when urinating are relevant, but the lack of fever does weaken the case for pyelonephritis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported, but there are some inaccuracies in linking findings to nephrolithiasis (specifically the inclusion of costovertebral angle tenderness) and some uncertainty regarding pyelonephritis due to the lack of fever. The links are not entirely correct or complete, but they do not significantly impact patient care.

Given these considerations, I would rate this section as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CBC UA Urine culture CT scan of abdomen and ureters 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we need to analyze the tests included:

1. **CBC** - This test is not mentioned in the answer key. While it may be useful in some contexts, it is not required or acceptable based on the rubric.
2. **UA (Urinalysis)** - This is a required test and is correctly included.
3. **Urine culture** - This is not mentioned in the answer key but is generally a reasonable test to include when considering urinary symptoms. However, it is not listed as essential or acceptable in this specific rubric.
4. **CT scan of abdomen and ureters** - This is listed as an acceptable test in the answer key.

Now, let's assess the overall plan:
- The required UA is included, which is good.
- The CT scan is acceptable.
- However, the inclusion of the CBC and urine culture does not align with the rubric's expectations. The CBC is unnecessary, and the urine culture is not specified in the answer key.

Given that the plan includes the essential UA and an acceptable CT scan but also includes unnecessary tests (CBC and urine culture), it does not fully meet the standard for a high score.

Thus, this plan would fall into the category of a reasonable plan but with some unnecessary tests included.

Final score: 3

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 63 yo M who presents with right flank pain. The pain started 1 day ago and comes in sharp bursts and is 9/10 severe pain at its worst. The pain radiates down to his groin and is associated with frequency and dysuria. He has felt quite nauseous during the pain episodes and has vomited twice. The patient denies diet changes, belly pain, chest pain, SOA, constipation, diarrhea, fevers, or chills. He recently went to the gym for the first time in a while and used the rowing machine. ROS: reviewed and negative except for as noted in the HPI PMH: Gout two years ago PSH: None Meds: None Allergies: NKDA FH: Mother had gallstones SH: Works insurance in the office. Not physically active. Diet ok. No tobacco, Drinks alcohol twice a month. No recreational drugs
Response: The HPI provided contains several key elements but also has some omissions and disorganization. 

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient mentions right flank pain, which is good.
2. **Duration**: The pain started 1 day ago, which is clear and concise.
3. **Character of pain**: The pain is described as sharp and severe (9/10), but there is no mention of spasms or colic, which is a key part of the rubric.
4. **Associated symptoms**: The patient reports nausea and vomiting, which are documented clearly. However, the vomiting is described as "twice" but does not specify if it was clear/nonbloody/nonbilious.
5. **Dysuria and urgency**: The patient reports frequency and dysuria, but it is not explicitly stated that he has urgency. 
6. **Pertinent negatives**: The patient denies hematuria, which is a pertinent negative, but other pertinent negatives (like the absence of diet changes, belly pain, etc.) are somewhat scattered and not clearly organized.

Overall, while the HPI contains most of the key information, it lacks the full detail regarding the pain's character (spasms/colic) and the clarification regarding the nature of the vomiting. Additionally, the organization of the information could be improved.

Given these observations, I would score this section as a 3, since most key historical findings are documented and organized, but there are some missing pertinent negatives and slight disorganization.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 63yo M who presents with colicky pain in the right flank associated with nausea without fever
Response: To evaluate the provided statement according to the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements present in the patient's description of symptoms.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - This element is missing.
2. **Right flank pain** - This element is present ("colicky pain in the right flank").
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - This element is missing; there is no mention of the intensity level.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - This element is present ("colicky pain").
5. **Optional elements** - Nausea is mentioned, but non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, or afebrile status is not addressed. However, nausea can be considered relevant to the optional category.

Now, let's assess the total number of elements:
- Present: 2 (Right flank pain, colicky pain)
- Missing: 2 (Acute onset, intensity level)
- Optional: 1 (Nausea)

Since the statement is missing 2 essential elements and has a total of 5 elements, it falls under the category of "Missing multiple essential elements."

Based on the rubric:
- **Score: 2**

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1) Nephrolithiasis 2) Pyelonephritis
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes two key conditions: nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. 

1) Nephrolithiasis is a correct interpretation of the findings, especially if the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of kidney stones, such as severe flank pain or hematuria. 
2) Pyelonephritis is also a reasonable consideration, particularly if there are symptoms like fever, chills, or urinary symptoms that could indicate a kidney infection.

The differential diagnosis is pertinent and prioritized appropriately, as these two conditions are commonly associated with similar symptoms (e.g., flank pain, urinary symptoms) and are relevant to the patient’s presentation. There are no significant flaws in the prioritization, and both diagnoses align well with the findings.

Given this evaluation, I would score this section as a 4.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain

- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1) 1 day history of acute, colicky, severe pain is consistent with kidney stones. PE finding of costovertebral angle tenderness is also consistent. He states that his diet is not great, and this could be a contributing factor. Dysuria and frequency are uncommon with nephrolithiasis, but do not exclude the diagnosis. 2) Associated symptoms of dysuria and frequency are common with pyelonephritis as is the physical exam finding of costovertebral angle tenderness. However, there is no suprapubic tenderness or fever present making this diagnosis less likely
Response: To evaluate the provided support for the differential diagnoses, we need to assess how well the student's reasoning aligns with the rubric criteria.

1) The student correctly identifies that the 1-day history of acute, colicky, severe pain is consistent with nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). They also note the physical exam finding of costovertebral angle tenderness, which is relevant to both nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. However, the mention of dysuria and frequency being uncommon with nephrolithiasis is a bit misleading; while these symptoms are more typical of a UTI, their absence does not rule out nephrolithiasis. The statement about diet could suggest a predisposing factor but does not directly support a diagnosis. Overall, the links to nephrolithiasis are mostly correct but include minor inaccuracies.

2) The second part does a good job of discussing pyelonephritis, noting the associated symptoms and physical exam findings. The student correctly identifies that the absence of suprapubic tenderness and fever makes this diagnosis less likely, which is a reasonable assessment. However, the links to the diagnosis are not fully supported since the presence of costovertebral angle tenderness alone does not confirm pyelonephritis without other supporting symptoms.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported with some minor inaccuracies and missing links. The reasoning is logical and does not negatively impact patient care.

Based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 3 for this section.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1) Urinalysis and urine culture to rule out bacterial infection 2) Abdominal CT to check for kidney stones
Response: Let's evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup against the rubric.

1) The plan includes a Urinalysis (UA), which is a required test and essential for ruling out bacterial infections. This aligns with the rubric's expectations for an effective and efficient plan.

2) The plan also includes an Abdominal CT scan. While this may be considered acceptable for checking for kidney stones, it is not listed as a required test. However, it is relevant to the patient's symptoms if kidney stones are a concern.

The plan does not include any unnecessary tests, and it effectively addresses the need for a urinalysis while including a relevant imaging study. However, it does not cover all essential tests that could be included in a more comprehensive workup.

Given that it includes one required test and one acceptable test without unnecessary tests, I would assess this plan as reasonable but not fully comprehensive.

Based on the rubric, this plan would likely score a 3.

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a 63yo M who presents with colicky pain in the right flank associated with nausea without fever

Differential Diagnosis:
1) Nephrolithiasis 2) Pyelonephritis

Supporting Information:
1) 1 day history of acute, colicky, severe pain is consistent with kidney stones. PE finding of costovertebral angle tenderness is also consistent. He states that his diet is not great, and this could be a contributing factor. Dysuria and frequency are uncommon with nephrolithiasis, but do not exclude the diagnosis. 2) Associated symptoms of dysuria and frequency are common with pyelonephritis as is the physical exam finding of costovertebral angle tenderness.

Response: The organization of the provided note is generally clear and follows a logical structure. Each section is distinctly labeled, and the information is presented in a coherent manner. The History of Present Illness (HPI) is detailed and gives a good overview of the patient's symptoms, while the Physical Examination is well-organized with clear headings for each body system. The Summary concisely encapsulates the patient's main issues. The Differential Diagnosis is presented clearly, with supporting information provided for each potential diagnosis, and the Plan is straightforward and actionable.

However, there are minor issues with the organization. For instance, while the HPI and ROS are integrated, the ROS could be more distinctly separated to enhance clarity. Additionally, the Summary could be more explicitly labeled as such to avoid confusion with the HPI.

Overall, the majority of the features are organized, and information is presented in appropriate sections, but there are slight improvements that could be made for clarity.

Based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 3.

To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Patient presents today for right flank pain of 24 hour duration. Per patient, pain is sharp and intermittent in nature. When the pain comes on it will last for up to 20 minutes and is a 9/10 at its worst. Patient states that the pain will radiate from his back to his groin. He has associated nausea, vomiting, urinary urgency and dysuria. Patient has taken Tylenol with no relief. He denied experiencing anything similar to this before. ROS: As per HPI, otherwise negative PMH: Gout PSH: None FH: Gallstones in mom; HBP in dad SH: Works as insurance salesman, rarely drinks EtOH, denied tobacco products and illicit drug use Medications: none Allergies: none
Response: The provided HPI includes several key components but misses some important details from the answer key. 

1. **Duration**: The HPI correctly states that the right flank pain has been present for 24 hours.
2. **Quality**: The HPI mentions that the pain is sharp, which aligns with the answer key.
3. **Timing**: The HPI describes the pain as intermittent, with episodes lasting up to 20 minutes, which does not fully match the answer key's description of spasms or colic every 1-2 hours.
4. **Severity**: The severity of the pain is noted as 9/10, which is accurate.
5. **Associated Symptoms**: The HPI includes nausea and vomiting, but it does not specify that the vomiting is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious, which is a key detail. It does mention urinary urgency and dysuria, but does not mention hematuria, which is also a pertinent negative.
6. **Organization**: The HPI is generally well-organized, but the omission of some key details and the mismatch in the timing of pain episodes detracts from its completeness.

Overall, while the majority of key information is present and the note is organized, the missing details regarding the timing of pain episodes and the description of vomiting lead to a lower score.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: T-99.7 F HR- 85 BPM RR-16 BP-128/82 O2-99% ORA Physical exam General: AAOx3, ill appearing HEENT: Mucous membranes moist, no erythema Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, symmetrical chest rise Heart: RRR, no rubs, skips, murmurs GI: Abdomen nontender to light and deep palpation, no masses or hernias MSK: Positive right flank tenderness to percussion, no bruises or joint swelling Neuro: CN II-XII grossly intact, no focal deficits, normal gait Psych: Appropriate mood and affect, not responding to internal stimuli 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to identify the key components that were outlined in the answer key: 

1. **Normal vitals**: The vitals provided show a slight elevation in temperature but are otherwise normal. This could be considered a minor deviation from "normal" but does not significantly impact the overall assessment.
  
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The provided exam notes show "Positive right flank tenderness to percussion," which aligns with the key finding of costovertebral angle tenderness.

3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The note states "Abdomen nontender to light and deep palpation," which correctly documents the absence of abdominal tenderness.

Now, assessing the overall organization and completeness of the physical exam findings:

- The vital signs are mostly normal, with a slight fever noted.
- The positive finding of right flank tenderness is present.
- The absence of abdominal tenderness is documented.

However, the physical exam is quite detailed, with multiple systems documented, which could obscure the key findings. While there is a good amount of relevant information, there is a risk of disorganization due to the extensive detail in other systems that are not directly related to the key findings outlined in the answer key.

Based on the rubric:
- The presence of the key findings (positive costovertebral angle tenderness and no abdominal tenderness) is noted.
- However, the excessive detail in other areas could be seen as obscuring the key findings.

Overall, this would lead to a score of 3, as most key physical exam findings are documented and organized well, but it lacks some pertinent negatives and has a bit of disorganization due to the extensive detail.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 25 year old male presenting with acute onset right flank pain of 24 hour duration. The pain radiated to his groin and is exacerbated by percussion of right flank. 
Response: Let's evaluate Nathaniel Ryan's note against the rubric:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The note states "acute onset" and "24 hour duration," which covers this element.
2. **Right flank pain**: The note explicitly mentions "right flank pain."
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The note does not provide a specific intensity rating (like "10/10" or "severe intensity").
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The note does not mention spasms, colic, or that the pain comes in waves.
5. **Optional elements**: The note includes "radiated to his groin," which could be considered relevant but does not fulfill the optional elements listed in the rubric.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Essential elements present: 2 (acute onset, right flank pain)
- Missing essential elements: 2 (intensity, spasms/colic/waves)
- Total elements in the statement: 5 (including the details about the pain duration and radiation)

Based on the rubric:
- There are multiple essential elements missing.
- The statement does not have more than 5 total elements.

Thus, the score for this section is 2.

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Iliolumbar abscess
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to assess how well it aligns with the findings from the patient interview and whether the prioritization is appropriate.

1. **Nephrolithiasis (kidney stone/renal colic)** - This is a correct interpretation of findings, especially if the patient presented with symptoms like severe flank pain, hematuria, or urinary symptoms.

2. **Pyelonephritis (UTI/pyelonephritis)** - This is also a relevant diagnosis if there were indications of a urinary tract infection or systemic symptoms such as fever and chills.

3. **Iliolumbar abscess** - This diagnosis is less relevant unless there were specific findings indicating an infection or abscess in that area, which doesn't seem to be supported by the primary symptoms related to nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis.

Overall, the first two diagnoses are consistent and prioritized correctly, but the inclusion of iliolumbar abscess introduces an element that is less directly related to the primary findings, making the differential diagnosis somewhat broader and less focused.

Based on the rubric:
- The first two diagnoses reflect a correct interpretation of findings.
- The third diagnosis introduces an inaccuracy in prioritization.

Thus, the evaluation is that the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Patient is experiencing severe pain that radiates to his groin. The pain is intermittent and he has not had any relief with Tylenol. He also reports urinary urgency and dysuria. He has severe tenderness upon percussion of right flank. He has a PMH of gout which could be associated with the kidney stone. 2. Patient has tenderness to percussion over the right kidney. This could be from inflammation of the kidney secondary to an infection. He also has a fever, which we would expect to be present with pyelonephritis. However, the severe and intermittent pain points more towards nephrolithiasis. 3. Iliolumbar abscess is a possibility due to the patient having severe pain in his right flank and a fever. The tenderness to percussion of the right flank could be explained by inflammation in of the area secondary to an infection. However, I would expect this pain to be constant and for his gait to be affected, which is why this is last on my differential
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis presented, I will break down the support given for each potential diagnosis based on the information provided:

1. **Nephrolithiasis/Kidney Stone/Renal Colic**:
   - The patient has severe, intermittent right flank pain radiating to the groin, which aligns well with renal colic.
   - The pain is described as severe (9/10), which is consistent with kidney stones.
   - The presence of urinary urgency and dysuria supports the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis.
   - The PMH of gout is relevant as it can be associated with the formation of kidney stones.
   - The tenderness upon percussion of the right flank further supports this diagnosis.

2. **UTI/Pyelonephritis**:
   - The patient has right flank pain, urinary urgency, dysuria, and fever, which are consistent with pyelonephritis.
   - The tenderness over the right kidney is also indicative of possible kidney infection.
   - However, the severe and intermittent nature of the pain leans more towards nephrolithiasis, though this diagnosis is still appropriately linked.

3. **Iliolumbar Abscess**:
   - The mention of severe right flank pain and fever does create a possibility for this diagnosis.
   - However, the evaluator appropriately discusses the expected presentation of this condition, indicating that the pain would likely be constant and affect gait, which is not the case here. This shows critical thinking in the differential diagnosis process.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well supported by the information provided. The links to the diagnoses are correct, and the reasoning is complete, with appropriate consideration given to the patient's symptoms and history.

Based on the rubric:
- The differential diagnosis is excellent, well-supported, and the links to diagnoses are correct and complete.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CT scan of abdomen and pelvis U/A and urine culture labs
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we see that the student included a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which is an acceptable test. They also included a urinalysis (UA), which is required. However, they did not mention any of the other acceptable tests such as BMP or renal ultrasound, nor did they include any unnecessary tests. 

The plan does include the essential UA, but it could be considered lacking because it does not incorporate all the acceptable tests, which would have made it more comprehensive. Therefore, I would categorize this as a reasonable plan that includes most essential tests but lacks some additional acceptable tests.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 3.

Summary:
Nathaniel Ryan is a 25 year old male presenting with acute onset right flank pain of 24 hour duration. The pain radiated to his groin and is exacerbated by percussion of right flank. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Iliolumbar abscess

Supporting Information:
1. Patient is experiencing severe pain that radiates to his groin. The pain is intermittent and he has not had any relief with Tylenol. He also reports urinary urgency and dysuria. He has severe tenderness upon percussion of right flank. He has a PMH of gout which could be associated with the kidney stone. 2. Patient has tenderness to percussion over the right kidney.

Response: The organization of the provided note is mostly clear, with distinct sections for History of Present Illness, Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section is labeled appropriately, and the information is presented in a logical order. 

However, there are minor issues that could be improved. For example, the "ROS" (Review of Systems) is succinctly referenced as "As per HPI, otherwise negative," which is somewhat vague and could be expanded for clarity. Additionally, while the differential diagnosis is clearly outlined, the supporting information could be more concise and better integrated into the differential to enhance clarity.

Overall, the note is well-structured and organized, with only minor areas for improvement.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI -Middle aged male with 24 hours right flank pain -Pain is a sharp spasm every 1-2 hours that radiates from back towards groin -Has nausea, vomited a few times -Some urinary urgency and dysuria -Tried Tylenol which did not seem to help -Never had anything like this happen before ROS: denies hematuria, fevers, chills PMH: gout Allergies: none Meds: none PSH: none FH: mother with cholelithiasis, father with T2DM and hypertension SH: works as insurance manager, rarely drinks alcohol, no tobacco, no drugs
Response: The provided HPI includes several key elements that align with the rubric. 

1. **Right flank pain**: The HPI correctly identifies the location and duration of the pain (24 hours).
2. **Pain characteristics**: The description of the pain as "sharp" and occurring in spasms every 1-2 hours is included, which is accurate.
3. **Severity**: The intensity of the pain is not quantified in the HPI (missing the 9/10 rating), which is a pertinent negative.
4. **Nausea and vomiting**: Mention of nausea is present, and it indicates that the vomiting was "a few times," but it does not specify if the vomit was clear or nonbloody/nonbilious, which is another omission.
5. **Dysuria and urgency**: These symptoms are documented, which is good.
6. **Hematuria**: The review of systems (ROS) denies hematuria, which is appropriate.

Overall, while the majority of key information is present, there are omissions regarding the severity of the pain and the specifics of the vomiting. The HPI is organized and presents relevant information, but the missing details prevent it from achieving a higher score.

Based on the rubric:
- The HPI has most key positive historical findings documented and is mostly well organized, but it is missing some pertinent negatives, specifically the pain severity and details about the vomiting.

Thus, I would score this HPI a 3.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp 99.7 F, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, SpO2 99% on RA General: not in acute distress, well nourished HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, no cervical LAD, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, no murmurs, no LE edema, +2 PT pulses bilaterally Resp: LCAT Abd: bowel sounds present, no TTP, no rebound, Rosvings sign negative, right CVA tenderness MSK: 5/5 upper and lower extremity strength bilaterally
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we first identify the key findings that are relevant to the patient's symptoms based on the answer key.

The answer key specifies the following key physical exam findings:
1. Normal vitals
2. Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
3. No abdominal tenderness

Now, let's break down the provided physical exam findings:

1. **Vitals:** The provided vitals indicate a low-grade fever (Temp 99.7 F), which is not normal. However, the other vital signs (HR, RR, BP, SpO2) appear normal, so this section partially fulfills the requirement for "normal vitals."
   
2. **Costovertebral angle tenderness:** The provided findings indicate "right CVA tenderness," which is positive and aligns with the answer key.

3. **Abdominal tenderness:** The findings state "no TTP" (tenderness to palpation) and "no rebound," which aligns with the answer key requirement of "no abdominal tenderness."

Overall, the provided physical exam findings include:
- Normal vitals (partially, due to the fever)
- Positive costovertebral angle tenderness (present)
- No abdominal tenderness (present)

The physical exam is organized and includes relevant information, but it includes a low-grade fever, which is not consistent with "normal vitals." Additionally, while the findings are mostly well-organized, the inclusion of the fever could be seen as somewhat irrelevant in the context of the specified requirements.

Given these points, the score would be a 3, as most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but the fever affects the interpretation of "normal vitals," and there is a lack of pertinent negatives that could have been included.

2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle aged male with a history of gout presenting with 1 day of right flank pain, n/v, and dysuria.
Response: Let's evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric.

1. The statement mentions "1 day of right flank pain," which indicates an acute onset within the past 24 hours.
2. It includes "right flank pain," which is essential.
3. However, it does not mention the intensity of the pain (10/10 or severe).
4. It does not include any mention of spasms, colic, or that the pain comes in waves.
5. The statement includes "n/v" (nausea/vomiting) as an optional element, but it is not clear if it is non-bilious vomiting.
6. "Dysuria" is also mentioned but is not part of the essential elements.

Based on this evaluation:
- The statement is missing the intensity of the pain and the description of the pain (spasms/colic). 
- It has included more than 5 total elements (right flank pain, acute onset, n/v, dysuria).
- Therefore, it is missing multiple essential elements.

According to the rubric, this would score a 2.

Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is a common cause of renal colic and fits well with potential acute abdominal or flank pain, while pyelonephritis is a possible complication of a urinary tract infection that can also present with similar symptoms. 

Since both diagnoses are pertinent and reflect a good interpretation of the findings based on the answer key, they are prioritized correctly. There are no minor flaws in prioritization that would negatively impact patient care. The optional diagnoses of muscle strain and inguinal hernia were not included, but their absence does not detract from the overall relevance of the main diagnoses provided.

Based on this evaluation, the differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings and appropriately prioritized.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis -history of gout -acute onset -CVA tenderness -right flank pain radiating to groin -spasmodic nature of pain -nausea/vomiting -urinary urgency, dysuria -no fever/chills 2. Pyelonephritis -right flank pain/CVA tenderness -nausea/vomiting -urinary urgency, dysuria 
Response: To evaluate the provided differential diagnosis based on the scoring rubric:

1. **Nephrolithiasis**:
   - The student notes a history of gout, which is relevant and supports nephrolithiasis.
   - Acute onset is mentioned, aligning with the expected presentation.
   - Costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness is included, which is a significant finding for nephrolithiasis.
   - Right flank pain radiating to the groin is correctly identified and supports the diagnosis.
   - The spasmodic nature of the pain is consistent with renal colic.
   - Nausea and vomiting are included, which are common associated symptoms.
   - Urinary urgency and dysuria are mentioned, which can occur but are more typical in UTI/pyelonephritis rather than nephrolithiasis.
   - The absence of fever/chills is noted, which is appropriate as nephrolithiasis typically does not present with these symptoms.

2. **Pyelonephritis**:
   - Right flank pain and CVA tenderness are correctly identified and relevant.
   - Nausea and vomiting are included, which can occur in pyelonephritis.
   - Urinary urgency and dysuria are also mentioned, which are important for this diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis for nephrolithiasis is strong, with appropriate links to the patient findings. However, the inclusion of urinary urgency and dysuria in the nephrolithiasis section may be seen as a slight misalignment since these are more characteristic of UTI/pyelonephritis. The pyelonephritis section is appropriately supported, but the student did not include fever/chills, which is a common finding in pyelonephritis.

Given that the differential diagnosis is well-supported with minor inaccuracies that do not critically impact patient care, I would rate this as a score of 3.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. CT stone protocol (non contrast) 2. UA with urine culture 3. CBC 4. BMP
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we can see the following:

1. **CT stone protocol (non-contrast)** - This is an acceptable test as it can help identify kidney stones.
2. **UA with urine culture** - This is a required test and is appropriate for assessing urinary symptoms.
3. **CBC** - While this test can provide useful information, it is not specifically listed as essential or acceptable for the workup in the answer key.
4. **BMP** - This is an acceptable test, providing information on kidney function and electrolyte balance.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and acceptable tests (CT and BMP), but it also includes a CBC which is not mentioned as necessary or acceptable. This indicates that while the plan is reasonable, it includes some unnecessary tests.

Based on the rubric:
- The plan includes most essential tests (UA and acceptable tests) but also includes some unnecessary tests (CBC).
- Therefore, it falls into the category of a reasonable plan for diagnostic workup with some unnecessary tests.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI: Mr. Ryan is a middle aged male presenting with a couple days (I asked and forgot to write down. I think 3 days) of right flank pain associated with random episodes of sharp stabbing pain that lasts minutes. He is unable to identify things that make it better or worse, Tylenol had no effect. When pain is sharp it radiates centrally. ROS; no fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting. Has had some urinary urgency and burning. PMHX: gout, no meds or surgeries FMHX; mom had gallbladder removed, dad had T2DM and HTN Social: Sexually active with longstanding wife with hysterectomy as contraception. No tobacco. Has one drink once a month. Recently went to the gym to do a lot of NEW rowing exercises. Works as manager.
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI against the rubric, we can identify several aspects of the patient's history that align with the key information required:

1. **Duration of Pain**: The student notes "a couple days" but fails to provide a specific timeframe. They mention "I think 3 days," which is vague and could lead to confusion. The rubric emphasizes the importance of accurate and concise information.

2. **Nature of Pain**: The description of pain as "sharp stabbing pain" is appropriate. However, the absence of mention of "spasms" or "colic" every 1-2 hours is a significant omission.

3. **Severity of Pain**: The student does not quantify the pain on a scale (e.g., 9/10), which is a critical component of the rubric.

4. **Associated Symptoms**: The student states "no fevers, chills" but mentions "Has had some urinary urgency and burning," which could imply dysuria but does not explicitly mention it. The absence of nausea and vomiting is noted, but the student does not provide clarity on whether these symptoms are present or absent, particularly with the mention of "nausea, or vomiting" in the ROS.

5. **Relevant Negatives**: The student does not mention hematuria, which is a pertinent negative that should be included based on the answer key.

Overall, the HPI contains some relevant information but lacks key details and organization, particularly regarding the severity of pain, the nature of associated symptoms, and pertinent negatives. The documentation is somewhat disorganized, and critical elements are omitted.

Considering these points, I would assign a score of 2, as many key historical findings are omitted, and the history is disorganized or poorly documented.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: t-99.7 hr-85 rr-16 bp-128/82 99% on RA HEENT-negative Respi: negative CV-Negative no Peripheral edema ABdominal - no rebound guarding TTP. Right flank minimally Tender to palpation (TTP). CVA tenderness present on right\ MSK and Neuro- negative
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric:

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vitals are documented as t-99.7 hr-85 rr-16 bp-128/82 99% on RA, which indicates normal vital signs. This is a key finding.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The note states "CVA tenderness present on right," which indicates a positive finding for costovertebral angle tenderness.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note mentions "no rebound guarding" and "TTP" (tender to palpation) is only noted as "Right flank minimally TTP," which implies that there is some tenderness but does not explicitly state that there is no abdominal tenderness. The absence of abdominal tenderness could be inferred but is not clearly articulated.

Based on the rubric:

- The document includes normal vitals and acknowledges CVA tenderness.
- However, it lacks a clear statement about the absence of abdominal tenderness, which is a pertinent negative.
- The findings are generally well organized, but the omission of the clear negative about abdominal tenderness detracts from the completeness of the exam.

Considering these factors, the score would be a 3, as most key positive findings are documented and organized, but there is a missing pertinent negative.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle aged man with a history of gout, presenting with right flank pain that is intermittently severe, sharp and associated with urinary symptoms.
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement for Mr. Ryan based on the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements present in the statement and compare them to the answer key:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - This element is missing from the statement.
2. **Right flank pain** - This element is present.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - The statement mentions "intermittently severe," which aligns with "severe intensity," so this element is present.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - This element is not explicitly mentioned in the statement.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement does not mention non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, or afebrile status.

Now, let's count the essential elements:
- Present: Right flank pain, severe intensity
- Missing: Acute onset, spasms/colic/waves

The summary includes 2 essential elements but is missing 2 essential elements. There are no optional elements included.

According to the rubric:
- Since there are multiple essential elements missing (specifically acute onset and the description of pain), the score would be a 2.

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Muscle strain
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to consider how well it aligns with the findings and symptoms discussed in the patient interview.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: This is a pertinent diagnosis given that kidney stones can cause severe pain and other urinary symptoms. It aligns well with the common presentations in a patient experiencing renal colic, making it a top differential diagnosis. 

2. **Muscle strain**: While a muscle strain can cause pain, it is less relevant in the context of urinary symptoms or renal issues compared to nephrolithiasis. Therefore, it does not directly correlate with the primary concerns that would arise from the interview findings.

The differential diagnosis provided includes one highly relevant option (nephrolithiasis) and one that is less relevant (muscle strain). The prioritization could be considered flawed because the inclusion of muscle strain dilutes the focus on more critical diagnoses related to the urinary system.

Given this evaluation:
- The nephrolithiasis is correctly identified.
- The muscle strain is not as pertinent, which affects the overall prioritization.

Thus, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings but includes an option that is not as relevant, leading to minor flaws in prioritization.

Based on the rubric, this would score a 3.

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis - he is a middle aged man with a history of gout, which shows he had elevated uric acid at one point, if not still. He presents with dull right flank pain, with radiation towards the "center" of his body when he has severe, sharp pain lasting minutes. No alleviating or worsening factors, and tylenol has not helped. He has also had urinary burning and urgency, which could be supportive of sediment/stone in his urine. Furthermore, the urinary symptoms are unlikely due to STI as he has had one stable monogamous relationship for years. 2. Muscle strain - Also likely given the dull nature of the pain with short bursts of sharp stabbing pain. He recently preformed an exercise he is not used to doing, which involved a lot of low back pulling. He could have strained a muscle and feels the sharp pain on exertion, however, he would likely be able to identify movement as a trigger of pain. Would not explain urinary symptoms easily.
Response: To evaluate the provided support for the differential diagnosis, we will analyze each diagnosis mentioned and how well the student's reasoning aligns with the rubric criteria.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: 
   - The student correctly identifies the patient's history of gout as a potential link to nephrolithiasis due to elevated uric acid levels. 
   - However, the description of the pain as "dull" contradicts the expected sharp, intermittent, colicky nature of pain associated with kidney stones. 
   - The mention of "urinary burning and urgency" is relevant and suggests possible urinary involvement, but the student does not clearly connect these symptoms to nephrolithiasis in a definitive way. 
   - Overall, while there are some relevant points, the inaccuracies in the pain description and lack of stronger links to urinary symptoms weaken the support.

2. **Muscle strain**: 
   - The student provides a reasonable explanation for muscle strain, noting the recent exercise and the nature of the pain. 
   - However, the student acknowledges that muscle strain would not easily explain the urinary symptoms, which is a significant consideration in a differential diagnosis. 
   - The connection to the patient's activities is valid, but it does not encompass the full clinical picture.

Overall, the differential diagnosis presented has some appropriate elements, but there are several inaccuracies and incomplete connections that weaken the overall support. The links to nephrolithiasis are not entirely accurate, and while muscle strain is considered, it does not adequately explain all symptoms.

Based on the rubric:
- The differential diagnosis has some appropriate support but contains missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care significantly. 

Thus, I would score this section as a **3**.

I would also want a BMP to evaluate kidney function and involvement, as well as any existing electrolyte abnormalities that would help guide treatment.
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup, the following points are noted:

1. The plan includes a urinalysis (UA), which is required and essential for evaluating urinary symptoms.
2. A CT stone protocol is included, which is acceptable for assessing the presence and characteristics of kidney stones.
3. A BMP (basic metabolic panel) is included, which is also acceptable for evaluating kidney function and electrolyte abnormalities.

However, the plan does not include a renal ultrasound, which could be relevant in the context of kidney stones and urinary symptoms, but its omission does not severely detract from the effectiveness of the plan. There are no unnecessary tests included, and all essential tests are covered.

Overall, the plan is reasonable and covers the essential tests while avoiding unnecessary ones, placing it in the second category of the rubric.

Each section is labeled appropriately (HPI, Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan), which aids in understanding the flow of information. 

1. **History of Present Illness (HPI)**: The HPI provides a detailed account of the patient's symptoms, including duration, nature of pain, associated symptoms, and relevant past medical history. However, there is a minor issue with the mention of forgetting to write down the duration of the pain, which could reflect a lack of thoroughness in documentation.

2. **Physical Examination**: The physical exam findings are well-organized and clearly presented, with appropriate headings for each system examined.

3. **Summary**: The summary concisely encapsulates the key points of the case, reiterating the patient's history and presenting symptoms.

4. **Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis is clearly listed and provides rationale for each potential diagnosis, demonstrating a good understanding of the clinical scenario.

5. **Supporting Information**: This section effectively supports the differential diagnoses with relevant clinical reasoning and considerations.

6. **Plan**: The plan is well-structured, outlining specific tests and evaluations that are appropriate given the clinical presentation.

Overall, the note is mostly organized with information presented in appropriate sections, but the minor issue in the HPI regarding the duration of pain could be seen as a lack of thoroughness. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall organization.

Based on the rubric, I would assess this note as having most features organized with information presented in appropriate sections.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI: -Sharp right sided flank pain started 24 hours ago -episodic in nature, lasts 2-20minutes -pain radiates to right groin -9 out of 10 pain severity during episodes, baseline pain 2 out of 10 -burning with urination and increased urination frequency over past 24 hours -no alleviating factors (acetaminophen did not help the pain) -no exacerbating factors, no correlation of pain with food intake ROS: pertinent positives: nausea with spasms, non-bloody vomiting. pertinent negatives: no abdominal pain, no chest pain, no difficulty breathing, no constipation, no diarrhea, no fever, no headaches. PMH: Gout PSH: No past surgeries Meds: None. Allergy: No known drug allergies Social: No alcohol use, no tobacco use, no marijuana use, no cocaine use. Family Hx: gallstones (mother)
Response: To evaluate the provided HPI against the rubric, we will assess the presence and organization of key information.

1. **Key Information Present**:
   - The HPI mentions "sharp right sided flank pain" and specifies the onset as "started 24 hours ago," which aligns with the acute nature of the pain expected in the answer key.
   - The description of the pain as "episodic in nature, lasts 2-20 minutes," however, does not match the expected "spasms OR colic every 1-2 hours." This is a significant omission.
   - The severity of the pain is reported as "9 out of 10," which is included correctly.
   - The HPI mentions "burning with urination and increased urination frequency," which indicates dysuria and urgency, but does not explicitly state "dysuria" or "urgency."
   - There is no mention of hematuria, which is a pertinent negative finding in the answer key.

2. **Organization**:
   - The information is generally well-organized, with clear sections for HPI, ROS, PMH, PSH, Meds, Allergies, Social, and Family History.
   - However, the disorganization in the timing and episodes of the flank pain could confuse the reader, as the intervals do not align with the expected findings.

3. **Irrelevant Information**:
   - There are no significant irrelevant details present, which is a positive aspect.

Based on this assessment:
- The HPI contains some key information but misses critical details such as the frequency of spasms and the explicit mention of dysuria.
- The organization is acceptable, but the details about the pain episodes are not aligned with the expected findings.

Considering these points, the score for this HPI would be a 2, as many key historical findings are omitted, and the history is somewhat disorganized.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vital signs: Temp: 99.7 F, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, O2 99% on RA Constitutional: ill-appearing HEENT: No oral erythema, dentition unremarkable, no cervical lymphadenopathy Cardiac: Normal rate and rhythm, no edema, symmetric 2+ pedal pulses. Respiratory: Normal breathing effort, no accessory muscle use. No crackles, rhonchi, or wheezing. Abdominal: No abdominal distention. Bowel sounds present. No pain with light or deep palpation in all 6 quadrants (LUQ, LLQ, RUQ, RLQ, epigastric, suprapubic). Positive CVA tenderness on right, Negative CVA tenderness on left. Neuro: PEERL, EOM intact, UE strength 5/5 and symmetric, LE strength 5/5 and symmetric. Normal Gait.
Response: The provided physical exam findings include both normal and abnormal results, which indicates a variety of assessments were conducted. 

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are documented clearly and show normal values, except for a slightly elevated temperature.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: This is noted as positive on the right side, which is a key finding.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note clearly states that there is no pain with light or deep palpation in all quadrants, indicating a thorough examination of the abdomen.

The organization of the findings is logical, following a systematic approach through different body systems. However, there is a slight omission in explicitly stating "no abdominal tenderness" in a more direct way, as it is implied but not stated outright.

Overall, the physical exam findings are mostly complete, well organized, and relevant, but the omission of a clear statement regarding the absence of abdominal tenderness affects the score.

Based on the rubric:
- The note includes almost all key physical exam findings.
- It is concise and organized, but lacks a direct mention of pertinent negatives (specifically, the absence of abdominal tenderness).

Given these considerations, I would score this section as a 3.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan (Nathan) is a middle-aged male with presenting with 24 hour history of right sided, sharp, episodic flank pain radiating to the groin associated with burning on urination and increased urinary frequency.
Response: Let's break down the provided note against the rubric and answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The note mentions a "24 hour history," which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The note states "right sided, sharp, episodic flank pain," which meets this requirement.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity is not explicitly stated as 10/10 or severe; it only describes the pain as "sharp" and "episodic." This is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The description of the pain as "episodic" could imply that it comes in waves, but it does not explicitly mention spasms or colic. This is somewhat ambiguous but can be interpreted as meeting this requirement.
5. **Optional**: The note mentions "burning on urination and increased urinary frequency," which are additional symptoms but not the optional elements listed in the rubric.

Now, evaluating the total elements:
- The note has 4 main elements clearly identified (acute onset, right flank pain, episodic pain, and optional symptoms).
- It is missing the explicit intensity descriptor (10/10 or severe).

Based on the rubric:
- The note is missing 1 essential element (the intensity), and it has more than 5 total elements if we consider the optional symptoms as additional elements.

Thus, this note would score a 3.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: Kidney Stone Pyelonephritis UTI 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, let's analyze the components based on the rubric.

1. The first diagnosis mentioned is "Kidney Stone," which aligns well with the symptoms typically associated with nephrolithiasis/renal colic. This is a correct interpretation of findings.
2. The second diagnosis is "Pyelonephritis," which is also relevant and consistent with urinary tract infections and potential kidney involvement. This reflects a good understanding of the possible complications arising from a UTI.
3. The third diagnosis is "UTI," which is a broad diagnosis but still pertinent given the context of the symptoms.

Overall, the differential diagnoses provided are relevant and generally consistent with the findings, though the prioritization could be refined. For instance, "Kidney Stone" is often a more acute concern compared to "UTI," and "Pyelonephritis" might be considered a complication of UTI rather than a separate primary diagnosis.

Given these observations, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, but there are minor flaws in prioritization, specifically in how they are listed. However, these flaws would not negatively impact patient care.

Based on this assessment, I would assign a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Kidney Stone -short episodic sharp pain in right flank which characteristically radiates to groin -right sided CVA tenderness characteristic of kidney stone -increased urinary frequency, burning sensation with urination, and presence of fever may be due to stone acting as nidus of infection or urinary stasis causing infection 2. Pyelonephritis -presence of fever and ill-appearing -CVA tenderness present -increased urinary frequency and burning with urination -presence of nausea and vomiting may indicate more systemic concern -less likely due to episodic nature of pain and radiation of pain to groin 3. UTI -increased urinary frequency and burning sensation with urination supports UTI -presence of fever supports infection diagnosis -less likely due to absence of suprapubic pain -right CVA tenderness more concerning for kidney pathology -pain radiating to groin less likely due to UTI
Response: The differential diagnosis presented includes three potential conditions: kidney stone, pyelonephritis, and UTI. 

1. **Kidney Stone**: The student notes short episodic sharp pain in the right flank, which radiates to the groin. They mention right-sided costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness and connect increased urinary frequency and burning sensation with urination to the possibility of infection or urinary stasis caused by the stone. This is a strong link to the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, and the reasoning is well-supported.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: The student identifies the presence of fever and an ill-appearing patient, along with CVA tenderness, which supports this diagnosis. They correctly note that the episodic nature of the pain and its radiation to the groin makes pyelonephritis less likely, which shows critical thinking in the differential diagnosis process.

3. **UTI**: The student acknowledges increased urinary frequency and burning sensation with urination, which supports a UTI diagnosis. However, they correctly point out that the absence of suprapubic pain and the CVA tenderness being more concerning for kidney pathology weakens the likelihood of UTI as the primary diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well supported, with appropriate links made to the findings presented in the patient interview. There are no major incorrect links that would negatively impact patient care, although the reasoning for UTI could have been slightly more robust. 

Given the strengths and minor weaknesses in the reasoning, I would rate this as a level 3 on the rubric.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score:  -@CBC (WBC) -@CT abdomen (kidney) -@urine culture
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we can break down the components:

1. **Required Tests**: The rubric specifies that a Urinalysis (UA) is required, but the provided plan does not include a UA. Instead, it includes a CBC, which is not listed as required or acceptable in the answer key.

2. **Acceptable Tests**: The plan includes a CT abdomen, which is acceptable, but it is not specified that this is for the kidneys. The urine culture is also acceptable but not specifically mentioned in the answer key.

3. **Unacceptable Tests**: There are no unacceptable tests included in the plan.

Based on this analysis:
- The plan misses the essential UA test, which is critical for the workup.
- Including the CBC, which is not part of the required or acceptable tests, suggests an ineffective approach.

Given that essential tests are missed and there are irrelevant tests included, this plan falls under the "Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup" category.

Thus, the score for this plan is:

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Pt reports persistent dull R flank pain beginning yesterday afternoon. Pt reports the pain is intermittently sharp & shooting radiating to his back and into R lower abdomen. Episodes last 2-15 minutes and associated with n/v for the longer episodes. Pt also reports increased urinary urgency/frequency, and dysuria. Denies blood or particulate matter in urine. Pain is not relieved with tylenol. Pain caused pt to have to leave work yesterday. Pt also reports rowing several days ago and reports diffuse muscle soreness. ROS: General: Denies fever, fatigue, chills CV/Resp: No chest pain, no SOA Abd: Pain and urinary sx as described above. No constipation PMHx: No chronic medical conditions No allergies, surgeries, medications Gout 2 years ago FH: Mom - gallstones Dad- Diabetes, HTN Siblings - healthy SH: Works at insurance company, non-smoker,1 glass of wine/month, no illicit drug use 
Response: To evaluate the provided HPI (History of Present Illness) against the rubric:

1. **Key Information Presence**: The patient reports right flank pain, which is acute and has been ongoing for about 24 hours. The description of the pain is somewhat mixed (dull vs. sharp), and while it mentions episodes, it does not specify the severity as 9/10, which is a key detail in the answer key. 

2. **Conciseness and Organization**: The information is generally organized, but the mixing of descriptions (persistent dull vs. intermittent sharp) may lead to confusion. The mention of muscle soreness from rowing is extraneous to the immediate symptoms and could be considered irrelevant in this context.

3. **Missing Information**: The HPI does contain nausea and vomiting, but it does not specify whether the vomiting is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious, which is a key detail from the answer key. The urgency and dysuria are mentioned, but there's no mention of hematuria, which is noted as a pertinent negative in the rubric.

Overall, while most of the key historical findings are present, there are critical omissions regarding the severity of pain and the nature of the vomiting, and the organization could be improved. 

The score for this HPI based on the rubric is a 2, as many key historical findings are omitted and the history is somewhat disorganized.

2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals Temp 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 99% on RA General: Ill-appearing, uncomfortable HEENT: No LAD, PERRL CV: Nl s1/s2, no murmurs Resp; CTAB Abd: R CVA tenderness, soft nontender abdomen, +BS, Negative Murphy sign MSK: Moving all extremities equally, 5/5 strength in upper and lower extremities 
Response: In evaluating the provided physical exam findings against the rubric:

1. **Key Physical Exam Findings**: The note includes normal vital signs, which are essential, and it also documents positive costovertebral angle tenderness, which is a key finding. However, it does not explicitly mention the absence of abdominal tenderness, which is a pertinent negative that should have been included to provide a complete picture of the abdominal exam.

2. **Organization and Relevance**: The findings are generally well organized, with sections clearly delineated (General, HEENT, CV, Resp, Abd, MSK). However, the presence of some irrelevant details could be considered, such as the specifics of the cardiovascular findings, which may not be directly relevant to the presenting complaint unless specified.

3. **Conciseness**: The note is somewhat detailed but does not obscure the key findings. The information presented is relevant to the assessment of the patient's condition.

Given these points, the physical exam findings include most key positive findings, but the omission of a pertinent negative (abdominal tenderness) affects the completeness of the documentation.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section a 3.

2. **Right flank pain** - The statement mentions "R flank pain," which fulfills this criterion.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - The statement does not specify the intensity of the pain, so this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - The statement describes the pain as "intermittently radiates w/ sharp pain," which suggests some form of colic or spasms, but it is not explicitly stated. This may be considered somewhat ambiguous.
5. **Optional elements** - The statement includes "n/v" (nausea/vomiting) which is part of the optional elements but does not mention "Right groin pain" or "afebrile."

Based on the analysis:
- The statement has fulfilled 2 out of the 4 essential elements (acute onset, right flank pain).
- It is missing the intensity and the explicit mention of spasms or colic.
- Considering the ambiguity regarding the spasms and the missing intensity, I would categorize this as missing multiple essential elements.

According to the rubric:
- The score would be 2 for "Missing multiple essential elements."

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Acute pyelonephritis 2. Choledocholithiasis 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to compare it against the answer key and the rubric criteria.

The answer key includes:
1) Nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) Muscle strain
Optional) Inguinal hernia

The provided differential diagnosis is:
1. Acute pyelonephritis
2. Choledocholithiasis

Now, let's analyze this:

1. **Acute pyelonephritis** is consistent with the answer key as it is a type of urinary tract infection that can result from a kidney stone, and it reflects a correct interpretation of findings related to renal pain and urinary symptoms.

2. **Choledocholithiasis** (bile duct stones) is not relevant to the symptoms typically associated with kidney-related issues. This condition does not align with the findings expected from a patient presenting with possible kidney stones or urinary tract issues.

Considering these points:
- The first diagnosis is pertinent and correctly prioritized.
- The second diagnosis is inconsistent with the findings related to the patient's symptoms.

Based on the rubric:
- Since the differential diagnosis includes one correct diagnosis and one irrelevant diagnosis, it is not fully consistent with the findings.

Therefore, I would rate this as:
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized.

Final score:
2

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Acute pyelonephritis 2/2 urolithiasis/nephrolithiasis - Sx of acute persistent dull R flank pain with intermittent sharp pain radiating to back and RL abdomen lasting 2-15 minutes assoc with dysuria, n/v, increased urinary urgency/frequency support. R CVA tenderness on exam. Ill-appearing. Consistent with acute pyelonephritis d/t kidney/ureteral stones 2. Choledocholithiasis - Family hx of gall stones. Acute persistent dull R flank pain with intermittent sharp pain. However, pain would be more localized to RUQ and on exam pt denies RUQ pain w/ neg murphy sign. Also would not cause urinary sx.
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, let's break down the support for each diagnosis based on the criteria in the rubric.

1. **Acute Pyelonephritis**: 
   - The symptoms described include right flank pain, which is consistent with pyelonephritis. The mention of acute persistent dull pain with intermittent sharp pain aligns with the expected presentation. 
   - The associated symptoms of dysuria, nausea, vomiting, and increased urinary urgency/frequency are relevant and support the diagnosis.
   - The physical exam finding of right costovertebral angle tenderness also supports this diagnosis.
   - Overall, this differential diagnosis is well-supported with accurate links to patient findings.

2. **Urolithiasis/Nephrolithiasis**: 
   - The symptoms of right flank pain, nausea, and vomiting are appropriate for nephrolithiasis as well. The acute nature of the pain and the description of it being sharp and intermittent further support this diagnosis.
   - However, the linkage to the patient's history of gout is not explicitly mentioned here, which could strengthen this diagnosis.
   - Overall, the support for this diagnosis is strong but slightly less complete than for pyelonephritis.

3. **Choledocholithiasis**: 
   - The reasoning provided states that the pain would be more localized to the right upper quadrant (RUQ) and that the patient denies RUQ pain with a negative Murphy sign, which is correct.
   - The family history of gallstones is relevant, but the conclusion that this diagnosis would not cause urinary symptoms is accurate and indicates a good understanding of the condition.
   - However, the linkage to the patient’s symptoms is not as strong as the first two diagnoses.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well-supported, with clear reasoning and appropriate connections made for acute pyelonephritis and urolithiasis/nephrolithiasis, even if there are slight gaps in the linkage for nephrolithiasis. The discussion about choledocholithiasis correctly identifies it as less relevant but does not detract significantly from the overall quality of the differential diagnosis.

Given this analysis, I would assign a score of 3 because the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported but with some missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care.

Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. UA 2. CBC, CMP 3. CT Abd/pelvis without contrast
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup based on the rubric and answer key:

1. The plan includes a UA, which is required.
2. The CBC and CMP are acceptable tests, but they are not mentioned in the answer key as essential or necessary for this specific case. Their inclusion could be seen as unnecessary unless justified by the patient's symptoms.
3. The CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast is acceptable according to the answer key.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and acceptable tests (CT abdomen/pelvis), but it also includes the CBC and CMP, which may not be essential based on the provided criteria. Therefore, while the plan is reasonable, it includes some unnecessary tests.

Based on the rubric:
- It is a reasonable plan that includes most essential tests but also some unnecessary ones.

Thus, the appropriate score for this plan is 3.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Patient is a 49yoM with no PMH presenting to the ED for right flank pain. He says that the pain started 24 hours ago and characterizes it as intermittent and exacerbating to 8-9/10 on the pain scale. It localizes to his posterior right flank and does not move. Ibuprofen has not relieved his symptoms and he has experienced nausea/vomiting twice. His symptoms have prevented him from going to work. He also endorses some "twinges" in his right groin. He and his wife recently started going to the gym 1 month ago and he endorses using a rowing machine 3 days ago. He sticks to a low-sugar diet of mainly leafy greens and fish. He has never had an episode of pain similar to this one. ROS: negative for chest pain, SOA, fevers, chills, constipation, diarrhea, hematuria, hematochezia, headache. Positive for nausea, vomiting PMH: gout (onset as young adult; last flare >2 years ago) Meds: negative Allergies: negative Family history: gout, mother had gallstones and CCY Social history: lives in Lexington with wife, has a glass of wine once per month, negative for tobacco or illicit substance use. Surgeries/hospitalization: negative
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI against the rubric, we can analyze the following key components:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient reports right flank pain that started 24 hours ago, which is present and documented.
2. **Characterization of pain**: The pain is described as intermittent and exacerbates to 8-9/10 on the pain scale. While "sharp" is missing, the severity is addressed.
3. **Spasms or colic**: The patient describes "twinges" in the right groin, which does not clearly indicate spasms or colic every 1-2 hours as per the answer key.
4. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient reports nausea and vomiting twice, which is documented clearly.
5. **Dysuria and urgency**: The review of systems (ROS) is negative for hematuria, which is documented correctly.
6. **Overall organization**: The history is fairly well organized, but some key details such as the nature of the pain (sharp) and the specific frequency of spasms/colic are missing.

Based on the rubric:
- The note includes most of the key positive historical findings and is organized, but it is missing some pertinent negatives and specific descriptors (sharp pain and spasms/colic).
- It does not meet the criteria for "almost all key information" due to the missing details.

Therefore, I would score this section a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Temp = 99.7F, HR = 85, RR = 16, BP = 128/82, O2 = 99% on RA HENT: normal dentition, oropharynx without erythema, no LAD Neuro: PERRLA, 5/5 strength in bilateral UE and LE Cardio: RRR, no extraneous heart sounds, tibialis pulses intact bilat, no pitting edema over lower tibias bilat Resp: CTAB Abdominal: normal to inspection, no tenderness to deep palpation, bowel sounds present on auscultation. Positive right CVA tenderness.
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we will consider the following aspects:

1. **Key Physical Exam Findings**: The answer key indicates that normal vital signs and positive costovertebral angle tenderness are essential findings. The provided physical exam does include normal vital signs (Temp = 99.7F, HR = 85, RR = 16, BP = 128/82, O2 = 99% on RA) and does mention positive right costovertebral angle tenderness.

2. **Missing Pertinent Negatives**: The provided physical exam does mention "no abdominal tenderness" and other relevant findings that might help clarify the patient's condition. However, while it documents some pertinent negatives, it does not explicitly mention the absence of other key findings, such as the absence of any neurological deficits or specific cardiovascular concerns.

3. **Organization and Conciseness**: The physical exam is organized by system (HENT, Neuro, Cardio, Resp, Abdominal), which is good. However, it could be argued that there is some redundancy and detail that could be streamlined, particularly in the cardiovascular and neurological sections, which could obscure the key findings.

Based on these considerations, while the student has included most of the key findings and organized them well, there are some missing pertinent negatives and a bit of unnecessary detail. Therefore, I would score this section as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Patient is 49yoM presenting with 24 hours of intermittent right flank pain without fever or dysuria. 
Response: To evaluate the provided statement based on the rubric and the answer key, we will identify the essential elements present in the patient's description:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "24 hours," which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement includes "right flank pain," which satisfies this criterion.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not mentioned; therefore, this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The pain is described as "intermittent," which does not clearly indicate spasms, colic, or waves. This element is also not clearly satisfied.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement does not mention non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, or afebrile status.

Based on the evaluation:
- The statement includes 2 essential elements (acute onset/past 24 hours and right flank pain).
- It is missing multiple essential elements (intensity and description of pain).
- There are no optional elements included.

According to the rubric:
- Missing multiple essential elements corresponds to a score of 2.

Final score: 2

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis 3. UTI
Response: The provided differential diagnoses include nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, and UTI. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is the primary diagnosis and is appropriate given the common symptoms associated with this condition, such as severe flank pain.
2. Pyelonephritis is also a relevant diagnosis as it can occur as a complication of a UTI and presents with similar symptoms, especially if there are signs of infection.
3. UTI is a broader diagnosis that is consistent with the findings but is less specific than pyelonephritis in this context.

Overall, the differential diagnoses are relevant and reflect a good understanding of the patient's symptoms. However, the prioritization could be slightly improved by placing pyelonephritis before UTI, as it is a more serious condition that could arise from a UTI.

Given these points, I would score this differential diagnosis as a 3, as it is generally consistent with findings but has minor flaws in prioritization.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis

- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Acute onset, severe, intermittent, unilateral flank/groin pain, and same-sided CVA tenderness is consistent with a kidney stone. 2. CTA tenderness is also present in pyelonephritis, however the patients stable vital signs and lack of systemic signs such as fever, chills, or dysuria do not support pyelo. 3. A UTI may be present unilaterally, however the lack of systemic signs, abrupt onset, and lack of dysuria do not support this diagnosis. 
Response: The provided support for the differential diagnosis includes good reasoning for nephrolithiasis (kidney stone) being the primary diagnosis, as it aligns well with the acute onset, severe pain, and CVA tenderness. The reasoning is clear and links the patient's symptoms directly to the diagnosis, which is a strong point. 

The assessment of pyelonephritis is also well articulated, noting the presence of CVA tenderness but correctly identifying that the absence of systemic signs (fever, chills, dysuria) does not support this diagnosis. This shows an understanding of the key differentiators between these conditions.

The mention of a UTI is appropriately addressed, acknowledging that while it could be present, the lack of supporting symptoms (like dysuria and systemic signs) weakens this diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well supported, with correct and complete links to the diagnoses discussed. There are no significant gaps or incorrect links that would negatively impact patient care.

Based on this evaluation, I would score this section as a 4.

Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score:  -@ Noncontrast CT A/@P -@ IV fluids -@ Analgesics for pain mgmt -@ urinalysis
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we need to compare it against the rubric and the answer key.

The required test mentioned in the answer key is a urinalysis (UA), which is included in the plan. The acceptable tests include a CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, and renal ultrasound. 

The plan includes:
- Noncontrast CT (acceptable)
- IV fluids (not listed as required or acceptable, but could be considered supportive care rather than a diagnostic test)
- Analgesics for pain management (not a diagnostic test)
- Urinalysis (required)

The plan does include the required urinalysis and one acceptable test (CT). However, it also includes IV fluids and analgesics, which are not diagnostic tests. Since there are no unnecessary tests included and the essential tests are present, this plan can be considered reasonable but not efficient, as it includes some elements that are not directly related to the diagnostic workup.

Given that the plan includes the required UA and one acceptable test while lacking some essential elements (such as BMP or renal ultrasound), I would score this as a 3.

1) Most features are disorganized, with appropriate sections missing.. Here is the answer key for org: . Please evaluate the following org and provide a score: History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 49yoM with no PMH presenting to the ED for right flank pain. He says that the pain started 24 hours ago and characterizes it as intermittent and exacerbating to 8-9/10 on the pain scale. It localizes to his posterior right flank and does not move. Ibuprofen has not relieved his symptoms and he has experienced nausea/vomiting twice. His symptoms have prevented him from going to work. He also endorses some "twinges" in his right groin. He and his wife recently started going to the gym 1 month ago and he endorses using a rowing machine 3 days ago. He sticks to a low-sugar diet of mainly leafy greens and fish. He has never had an episode of pain similar to this one. ROS: negative for chest pain, SOA, fevers, chills, constipation, diarrhea, hematuria, hematochezia, headache. Positive for nausea, vomiting PMH: gout (onset as young adult; last flare >2 years ago) Meds: negative Allergies: negative Family history: gout, mother had gallstones and CCY Social history: lives in Lexington with wife, has a glass of wine once per month, negative for tobacco or illicit substance use. Surgeries/hospitalization: negative

Physical Examination:
Temp = 99.7F, HR = 85, RR = 16, BP = 128/82, O2 = 99% on RA HENT: normal dentition, oropharynx without erythema, no LAD Neuro: PERRLA, 5/5 strength in bilateral UE and LE Cardio: RRR, no extraneous heart sounds, tibialis pulses intact bilat, no pitting edema over lower tibias bilat Resp: CTAB Abdominal: normal to inspection, no tenderness to deep palpation, bowel sounds present on auscultation. Positive right CVA tenderness.

Summary:
Patient is 49yoM presenting with 24 hours of intermittent right flank pain without fever or dysuria. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis 3. UTI

Supporting Information:
1. Acute onset, severe, intermittent, unilateral flank/groin pain, and same-sided CVA tenderness is consistent with a kidney stone. 2. CTA tenderness is also present in pyelonephritis, however the patients stable vital signs and lack of systemic signs such as fever, chills, or dysuria do not support pyelo. 3. A UTI may be present unilaterally, however the lack of systemic signs, abrupt onset, and lack of dysuria do not support this diagnosis. 

Plan:
 -@ Noncontrast CT A/@P -@ IV fluids -@ Analgesics for pain mgmt -@ urinalysis


Response: The organization of the provided note is generally clear and follows a logical structure. The sections are well-defined, including a thorough History of Present Illness (HPI), a complete Physical Examination, a concise Summary, a well-structured Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and a clearly outlined Plan.

1. **History of Present Illness**: The HPI is detailed and includes relevant patient history, symptom description, and associated factors. 
2. **Physical Examination**: This section is organized and presents findings in a systematic manner, covering all relevant systems.
3. **Summary**: The summary succinctly encapsulates the key points from the HPI.
4. **Differential Diagnosis**: This is clearly listed and corresponds to the information provided in the HPI and physical exam.
5. **Supporting Information**: This section effectively explains the reasoning behind the differential diagnoses.
6. **Plan**: The plan is clearly delineated with actionable items.

There are no significant issues with disorganization, repetition, or missing sections. All features are organized appropriately, and the information flows logically from one section to the next.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nathanial Ryan is a middle aged man with previous history of gout who presented for R flank pain. Patient reports that he has been having sharp, spastic pain arou7nd his flank area and radiating anterior for 24 hours. Patient also reports having N/V, ueinary urgency, and burning with peeing. Patient reports that he tried tylenol but no relief with it. Patient reports no recent surgeries, trauma, and takes no medications. Patient says the only new thing was rowing that he did a few days ago at the gym but was doing it bilaterally. Patient denies any changes in bowel movement, diet, or abdominal pain. Patient says he has vomitted twice but it has not affected his PO intake. Nothing has made his pain worse or better PMH: Gout PSH: some alcohol use surgery: none medications: none ROS: 14 point ROS -ve other than stated in HPI. 
Response: To evaluate the HPI provided, we need to assess the presence and organization of key information based on the rubric.

1. **Key Information**: The HPI mentions right flank pain, which is relevant. It describes the nature of the pain as sharp and spastic, and it indicates the duration (24 hours). However, it lacks the specific severity rating (9/10 pain) that is in the answer key.

2. **Nausea and Vomiting**: The patient reports nausea and vomiting, but it could be clearer that the vomiting is nonbloody and nonbilious, which is important for clarity and completeness.

3. **Dysuria and Urgency**: The HPI mentions urinary urgency and burning with urination, which aligns with the rubric. However, it does not explicitly state that there is no hematuria, which is a key negative finding.

4. **Organization**: The information is somewhat organized; however, some details (like the history of rowing) could be considered irrelevant in the context of the acute presentation.

5. **Omissions**: There are several omissions, including the severity of pain and the specific nature of the vomiting. The absence of the hematuria detail is also significant.

Considering these points, the documentation contains many key findings but misses several critical details and lacks clarity in certain areas. Therefore, I would rate this HPI as a 2, as it is disorganized and omits key historical findings.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: 99.7*, HR= 85, RR=16, BP= 128/82, O2=99% constit: normal appearing, no acute distress HEENT: EOM, normal pupillary reflex, no LAD, head atraumatic Cardio: RRR, no abnormal HS, normal s1, s2, regular pedal pulses, no peripheral edema pulm: normal respiratrory effort, normal breath sounds abd: normal bowel sounds, no tenderness on exam MSK: R CVA tenderness, no L CVA tenderness, normal ROM, normal strength Neuro: normal reflexes, regular gait and tone and strength psych: normal behavior 
Response: The provided physical exam findings include a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition. 

1. **Vital Signs**: All normal vitals are documented, which aligns with the answer key.
2. **CVA Tenderness**: Positive costovertebral angle tenderness is noted on the right side, which is a key finding and aligns with the answer key.
3. **Abdominal Exam**: The note states "no tenderness on exam," which corresponds to the answer key indicating no abdominal tenderness.

The organization of the physical exam findings is clear and follows a systematic approach (vital signs, constitutional, HEENT, cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdominal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and psychiatric). There are no irrelevant details present, and the information is concise.

However, while the key findings are present, the absence of mention of pertinent negatives (like no left CVA tenderness) could be seen as a minor omission. 

Overall, the documentation is strong, but it lacks some completeness in terms of mentioning all pertinent negatives.

Based on this analysis, I would assign a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle aged male with PMH of gout who presented for R sided flank pain, Urinary urgency, and N/V. 
Response: To evaluate the provided statement against the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements from the answer key that are present in the summary.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - This element is not mentioned in the statement.
2. **Right flank pain** - Present ("R sided flank pain").
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - This element is not mentioned in the statement.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - This element is not mentioned in the statement.
5. **Optional elements** - "N/V" (non-bilious vomiting) is mentioned, which is an optional element.

Now, let's count the essential elements:
- Present: 1 (Right flank pain)
- Missing: 3 (Acute onset, 10/10 intensity, spasms/colic)

Since there are multiple essential elements missing, the score according to the rubric is:

2) Missing multiple essential elements.

Final score: 2

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. pyelonephritis 2. splenic infarct 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to assess how well it aligns with the findings from the patient interview regarding their symptoms.

1. Pyelonephritis: This is a relevant diagnosis given that kidney-related symptoms can often present similarly to those of nephrolithiasis. It is consistent with findings related to urinary tract issues.

2. Splenic infarct: This diagnosis does not align well with the symptoms typically associated with kidney stones or urinary tract infections. It is not relevant to the presenting symptoms and does not reflect a correct interpretation of the findings.

Overall, the differential diagnosis includes one pertinent option (pyelonephritis) and one irrelevant option (splenic infarct). This indicates that the differential diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the findings but includes an inaccurate prioritization.

Based on the rubric, this would fall into the category of "somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized," which corresponds to a score of 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: Most likely diagnosis is pyelonephritis with history reported of urinary urgency and burning with peeing as well as R sided tenderness. R CVA tenderness on exam indicates pyelonephritis as well. N/V can be secondary to the sharp pain patient is describing. Splenic infarct is less likely given description and PE of the pain as well as the lack of enciting evidence showing a splenic infarct or affect to spleen. 
Response: In evaluating the provided differential diagnosis, we can identify several strengths and weaknesses:

1. **Most likely diagnosis is pyelonephritis**: This aligns with the reported symptoms of right flank pain, nausea, and vomiting. However, the mention of urinary urgency and burning is not explicitly supported by the patient’s original symptoms, which could indicate a lack of comprehensive assessment of the patient’s urinary symptoms.

2. **Right CVA tenderness on exam indicates pyelonephritis**: This is a correct link between the physical examination findings and the diagnosis of pyelonephritis. 

3. **Nausea and vomiting can be secondary to sharp pain**: This is a reasonable connection, as severe pain can indeed lead to nausea.

4. **Mention of splenic infarct being less likely**: While this shows an understanding of differential diagnoses, it does not directly support the primary diagnosis of pyelonephritis. It does, however, demonstrate critical thinking in ruling out other conditions.

5. **Missing details**: The rationale for pyelonephritis lacks specific details such as the absence of dysuria and urgency, which are typically associated with urinary tract infections/pyleonephritis. The absence of these symptoms would weaken the support for the diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis presented is appropriately supported but has some missing links that could negatively impact patient care, particularly in not fully addressing the urinary symptoms that would support a diagnosis of pyelonephritis. 

Based on these observations, I would assign a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Plan would be to get an US of R flank region as well as bladder to better identify pathophysiology, as well as get a UA and urine culture. Patient is able to take PO so will treat with oral antibiotics- bactrim and wait on urine cultures. Patient will also receive oxycodone for the pain. 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan against the rubric, we need to assess the components of the diagnostic workup mentioned in the student's response.

1. **UA**: The plan includes a urinalysis (UA), which is required and appropriate.
2. **Ultrasound (US)**: The plan mentions obtaining an ultrasound of the right flank region and bladder. An ultrasound is an acceptable test according to the rubric.
3. **Urine Culture**: The student also plans to conduct a urine culture, which is a reasonable addition to the UA.
4. **Oral antibiotics (Bactrim)**: While treating the patient with antibiotics is a part of the management plan, it does not fall under the diagnostic workup. However, it is reasonable since the patient can take PO.
5. **Pain management with oxycodone**: Like the antibiotics, this is part of the treatment plan but not the diagnostic workup.

Now, considering the tests included:
- The plan includes the essential UA and an acceptable US, as well as a urine culture.
- There are no unnecessary tests mentioned, and the plan is consistent with the need to identify the pathophysiology.

Overall, the plan is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and does not include unnecessary tests. Therefore, it aligns with the highest level of the rubric.

Response: The organization of the provided patient note is generally clear and follows a logical structure. Each section is labeled appropriately, including History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. The information within each section is relevant and mostly well-organized, although there are some minor issues with clarity and formatting that could lead to slight confusion.

1. **History of Present Illness**: This section provides a comprehensive account of the patient's symptoms, history, and relevant details. However, there are minor grammatical errors (e.g., "ueinary" instead of "urinary") and some phrasing that could be improved for clarity. Overall, the information is organized but could be clearer.

2. **Physical Examination**: This section is detailed and organized, with findings clearly delineated by system. All relevant findings are included, and the format is consistent.

3. **Summary**: This section succinctly summarizes the key points from the HPI and physical examination, which is good for clarity.

4. **Differential Diagnosis**: The differential diagnoses are listed clearly, but there is no explanation of the reasoning behind the choices in this section, which could enhance understanding.

5. **Supporting Information**: This section provides a rationale for the most likely diagnosis, which is helpful. It is mostly well-organized, but the connection between the supporting information and the differential diagnosis could be clearer.

6. **Plan**: The plan is clear and outlines the next steps appropriately. 

Overall, while there are some minor issues with clarity and grammar, the majority of the information is organized into appropriate sections and presented logically. Therefore, the score falls between 3 and 4, leaning towards 3 due to the minor disorganization and clarity issues.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI: Patient is a middle aged man presenting with acute onset of right flank pain. Patient states that he has been having 9/10 pain directly over his right flank for the past 24 hours. He states that he has been having "waves" of sharp pain that last from 2-20 minutes and are associated with N/V. States that he has vomited two times due to severe pain. He states that he has not been drinking as much water as he thinks he should. Reports that he has never experienced anything like this before. The pain is localized to his specific right back. He has noticed increased urinary frequency, but not dysuria or blood in his urine. He has had good urine output and has drank two 16oz bottles of water since the start of the day. Patient is most worried that his mother had gallstones and is hoping that he does not have these as well. PMH - No medications, allergies. Only surgery was tonsillectomy. Chronic medical conditions include gout, which he treats with dietary modification. Family: mother with gallstones, Social: No Tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. ROS - No Chest pain, diarrhea, sore throat, shortness of breath, headaches/lightheadedness. 
Response: The HPI provided includes several key components:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient describes acute onset and specifies the location.
2. **Duration**: The pain has been present for 24 hours, which is documented.
3. **Quality of pain**: The patient rates the pain as 9/10 and describes it as sharp.
4. **Character of pain**: The description of "waves" of pain is somewhat analogous to spasms or colic, but the timing (2-20 minutes) is not exactly aligned with the rubric's expectation of every 1-2 hours.
5. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are mentioned, with details that the vomiting is clear and nonbloody/nonbilious.
6. **Dysuria and urgency**: The patient reports increased urinary frequency but denies dysuria and hematuria, which is relevant.
7. **Organizational quality**: The HPI is somewhat organized, but the inclusion of the patient's worry about gallstones, while relevant to family history, adds a level of concern that may not be directly pertinent to the acute symptoms.

Overall, the HPI captures most of the essential elements but misses the precise characterization of pain spasms, which could be considered a minor omission. The organization is mostly clear, but there are some slight deviations from the ideal structure.

Given the rubric:
- The key information is mostly present and fairly well organized, but there are some omissions and minor disorganization.

Based on this assessment, I would assign a score of 3.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: VS: HR 85 RR 16 O2 99% Temp 99.7F BP 128/82 Physical Exam: - HEENT: Normal oropharynx and dentition - Lymph: no lymphadenopathy - Cardio: Normal R/R, no murmurs or gallops auscultated. No edema, normal pedal pulses. - Pulm: Normal breathing effort and lung sounds - GI: No tenderness to palpation, normal bowel sounds, negative murphy sign. - GU: marked CVA tenderness on right side. Extremely sensitive to palpation. - Neuro: Normal EOM, pupillary light reflex. Normal muscle tone in upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Normal Gait. 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to identify the key findings in the answer key and compare them to the student's documentation.

Key findings from the answer key:
1. Normal vitals
2. Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
3. No abdominal tenderness

Now, let's analyze the student's documentation:

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vitals are documented as HR 85, RR 16, O2 99%, Temp 99.7F, BP 128/82. This is consistent with the key finding of "normal vitals."
   
2. **CVA Tenderness**: The student documented "marked CVA tenderness on right side" which is a positive finding and indicates the presence of costovertebral angle tenderness, aligning with the key finding.
   
3. **Abdominal Tenderness**: The student noted "No tenderness to palpation," which aligns with the key finding of "no abdominal tenderness."

Now, let's review the organization and completeness of the physical exam:
- The student included relevant findings from various systems (HEENT, Lymph, Cardio, Pulm, GI, GU, Neuro) which provides a comprehensive view of the physical exam.
- The findings are well organized and presented without irrelevant information.
- However, while the student documented the positive CVA tenderness, they did not explicitly mention the negative aspect of CVA tenderness on the left side, which could be considered a pertinent negative.

Given that:
- Almost all key exam findings are present (normal vitals, positive CVA tenderness, no abdominal tenderness).
- The organization is concise and clear, but there is a slight omission of a pertinent negative.

Based on this assessment, I would score this section as a 3.

I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Patient is a middle aged man presenting with acute onset of right flank pain associated with increased urinary frequency and N/V. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement based on the rubric and the answer key, we can break down the essential elements present in the statement:

1. **Acute onset** - Present ("acute onset")
2. **Right flank pain** - Present ("right flank pain")
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - Not explicitly mentioned, so missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - Not mentioned, so missing.
5. **Optional elements** - Non-bilious vomiting is implied by "N/V" (nausea and vomiting), but it does not specify if the vomiting is non-bilious, so it's unclear. Increased urinary frequency is also mentioned but does not fit into the optional elements provided.

Now let's summarize the findings:
- The statement includes acute onset and right flank pain, which are essential elements.
- It is missing the intensity of the pain and the description of the nature of the pain (spasms, colic, or waves).
- It does not exceed five total elements as it mainly focuses on the essential components.

Given that it is missing two essential elements, this would fall under the category of "Missing multiple essential elements."

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Urinary Tract Infection 
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes nephrolithiasis and urinary tract infection (UTI), both of which are appropriate given the potential symptoms associated with kidney stones and urinary tract issues. 

1) Nephrolithiasis is a correct interpretation of findings related to renal colic, which aligns well with the symptoms typically associated with kidney stones.
2) UTI is also a relevant differential diagnosis, as it can present with similar symptoms, especially if there is any urinary discomfort or changes in urination.

The prioritization of these two diagnoses appears correct, as nephrolithiasis is often a more urgent concern due to the potential for acute pain and complications, while UTI is also significant but may be seen as slightly less emergent in certain contexts.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is pertinent and prioritized correctly based on the symptoms presented. There are no significant flaws in the prioritization that would negatively impact patient care.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis - Patient most likely has a kidney stone. Things that lead me to this diagnosis include the patients acute onset of symptoms, location of pain, history of gout, demographic information (middle aged male), extreme tenderness to palpation with CVA tenderness, and lack of water intake. He is also afebrile indicating it is less likely an infectious cause. No dysuria or pain with urination consistent with kidney stone. 2. Urinary Tract Infection/pyelonephritis: On my differential because of acute onset symptoms, increased urinary frequency, CVA Tenderness, and borderline temperature. Lack of hematuria also indicates that this could be something other than a kidney stone. 
Response: In evaluating the differential diagnosis provided:

1. **Nephrolithiasis**:
   - The student correctly identifies nephrolithiasis as the most likely diagnosis. They mention the acute onset of symptoms, location of pain, and history of gout, which are all relevant points that support this diagnosis. The mention of the patient being afebrile helps to rule out infectious causes, which is a strong point. However, they incorrectly state "extreme tenderness to palpation with CVA tenderness," which is more indicative of pyelonephritis rather than nephrolithiasis. The absence of dysuria aligns with nephrolithiasis, but the overall support for this diagnosis is good despite the minor error.

2. **Urinary Tract Infection/Pyelonephritis**:
   - The student includes UTI/pyelonephritis in the differential diagnosis, citing acute onset symptoms, increased urinary frequency, and CVA tenderness. However, the mention of "borderline temperature" is vague and does not strongly support the diagnosis. Furthermore, the student incorrectly states that the lack of hematuria could indicate something other than a kidney stone, which may not be the best reasoning for including UTI/pyelonephritis in this context. 

Overall, the differential diagnosis is reasonably well supported, but there are inaccuracies in the links between findings and diagnoses, particularly with the CVA tenderness and the reasoning for UTI/pyelonephritis. The student has made a solid attempt but has some critical errors that impact the overall strength of their differential.

Considering these points, I would score this section as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. U/A with culture- Would like to look for LE and nitrates to see potential infection. Would also like to see if hematuria is present to rule in or out kidney stone. 2. Spiral CT/Renal ultrasound- would start with renal ultrasound to confirm if there is a stone present in the kidney. However, if unrevealing I would progress to a Spiral CT to truly confirm or deny a kidney stone. 
Response: The provided plan includes a urinalysis (UA) with culture, which is essential for assessing potential urinary tract infection and hematuria. This aligns well with the required tests. 

The plan also includes a renal ultrasound and a spiral CT scan, both of which are acceptable for evaluating kidney stones. The reasoning behind starting with a renal ultrasound and then progressing to a spiral CT if necessary is logical and efficient, as it minimizes unnecessary exposure to radiation while still allowing for comprehensive evaluation.

Overall, the plan includes all essential tests (UA) and acceptable tests (renal ultrasound, spiral CT) without including any unnecessary tests. Therefore, it is effective and efficient.

Based on the rubric, this plan fits the criteria for a score of 4.

1) Most features are disorganized, with appropriate sections missing.. Here is the answer key for org: . Please evaluate the following org and provide a score: History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is a middle aged man presenting with acute onset of right flank pain. Patient states that he has been having 9/10 pain directly over his right flank for the past 24 hours. He states that he has been having "waves" of sharp pain that last from 2-20 minutes and are associated with N/V. States that he has vomited two times due to severe pain. He states that he has not been drinking as much water as he thinks he should. Reports that he has never experienced anything like this before. The pain is localized to his specific right back. He has noticed increased urinary frequency, but not dysuria or blood in his urine. He has had good urine output and has drank two 16oz bottles of water since the start of the day. Patient is most worried that his mother had gallstones and is hoping that he does not have these as well. PMH - No medications, allergies. Only surgery was tonsillectomy. Chronic medical conditions include gout, which he treats with dietary modification. Family: mother with gallstones, Social: No Tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. ROS - No Chest pain, diarrhea, sore throat, shortness of breath, headaches/lightheadedness.

Summary:
Patient is a middle aged man presenting with acute onset of right flank pain associated with increased urinary frequency and N/V. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Urinary Tract Infection 

Supporting Information:
1. Nephrolithiasis - Patient most likely has a kidney stone. Things that lead me to this diagnosis include the patients acute onset of symptoms, location of pain, history of gout, demographic information (middle aged male), extreme tenderness to palpation with CVA tenderness, and lack of water intake. He is also afebrile indicating it is less likely an infectious cause. No dysuria or pain with urination consistent with kidney stone. 2. Urinary Tract Infection/pyelonephritis: On my differential because of acute onset symptoms, increased urinary frequency, CVA Tenderness, and borderline temperature. Lack of hematuria also indicates that this could be something other than a kidney stone. 

Plan:
1. U/A with culture- Would like to look for LE and nitrates to see potential infection. Would also like to see if hematuria is present to rule in or out kidney stone. 2. Spiral CT/Renal ultrasound- would start with renal ultrasound to confirm if there is a stone present in the kidney. However, if unrevealing I would progress to a Spiral CT to truly confirm or deny a kidney stone. 


Response: The organization of the provided note is generally good. The information is presented in a clear and logical manner, with distinct sections for History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, and Plan. Each section contains relevant information that corresponds to the patient's clinical presentation.

1. **History of Present Illness (HPI)**: The HPI is detailed and organized, providing a clear narrative of the patient's symptoms and relevant medical history.
2. **Physical Examination**: This section is well-structured, with findings clearly categorized by system, making it easy to follow.
3. **Summary**: The summary succinctly encapsulates the main points from the HPI and physical examination, reinforcing the key issues.
4. **Differential Diagnosis**: The differential is clearly laid out, with rationales provided for each diagnosis, indicating a logical thought process.
5. **Plan**: The plan is clearly delineated and addresses the next steps in management, which is crucial for clinical reasoning.

There are no major disorganization issues or missing sections. All features are presented appropriately, and the information flows logically from one section to the next.

Based on this evaluation, I would score the organization of this note a 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: 40 yo male with PMH gout (last acute episode 2 yrs prior, no current pharmacologic management) presenting for sharp intermittent right flank pain that started 24 hrs ago. There are no associated exacerbating or relieving factors. He rates the pain as 9/10. Associated sx include nausea and emesis x2 of clear mucus consistency. Also having urinary urgency and dysuria, denies hematuria. No changes in BM or pain with BM. Pt notes no dietary changes and endorses a varied diet with fruits and vegetables. No red meat consumption. Pt went to gym 3 days prior and had generalized muscle soreness following exercise on rowing machine. ROS: Pertinent Negatives: No fever/chills, weight change, appetite, fatigue, chest pain, SOA, BM changes, bloody stools, rectal pain, hematuria, myalgias, arthralgias, skin rashes Pertinent Positives: N/V, urinary urgency, dysuria PMH: Gout 2 years ago Medications: Acetaminophen Fam HX: Mom - gallstones and gallbladder removed, Dad = DM, HTN Surg /Hospitalization HX: None Allergies: NKDA Social HX: Rare EtOH use (once monthly), non-smoker, no drug use 
Response: The HPI provided includes several key elements that align with the answer key but also has some omissions. Here's the breakdown based on the rubric:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient mentions "sharp intermittent right flank pain that started 24 hrs ago," which is accurate and includes the duration.
2. **Pain characteristics**: The pain is described as "sharp" and rated as "9/10," which is appropriate. However, the absence of mention of spasms or colic every 1-2 hours is a significant omission.
3. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are included ("N/V" and "emesis x2 of clear mucus consistency"), which is good. However, the vomiting should specify that it is "nonbloody/nonbilious" for full alignment with the answer key.
4. **Dysuria and urgency**: These symptoms are documented, and the mention of "denies hematuria" is correct.
5. **Overall organization and conciseness**: The HPI is fairly well organized, but the lack of certain details such as exacerbating or relieving factors and the omission of colic/spasms detracts from its completeness.

Given these points, while the HPI captures most of the key historical findings, it misses some pertinent negatives and specific details that are critical for a complete assessment.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: 99.7F 85 bpm 16 RR BP 128/82 99% O2 on RA GEN: Alert, non-distress, sitting up comfortably HEENT: EOM intact, no scleral icterus RESP: CTAB, no wheezes/crackles, normal respiratory effort CV: RRR, no murmurs or gallops, no peripheral edema ABD: Significant R. costovertebral tenderness (pt jumped), Normal BS and non-TTP all 6 abd quadrants, Negative Murphy, Negative Rovsing, No hepatosplenomegaly, no rigidity/guarding MSK: Normal ROM, 5/5 strength bilateral LE/UE NEURO: Alert and oriented PSYCH: Normal mood and affect SKIN: No rashes, chest hair 
Response: The provided physical exam findings include:

- Normal vitals
- Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
- No abdominal tenderness (noted as non-tender in all 6 quadrants)

In evaluating the physical exam note against the rubric:

1. **Normal Vitals**: This is documented correctly and is a key finding.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: This is also documented correctly and is a key positive finding.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: While the note states "non-TTP all 6 abd quadrants," it does not explicitly state "no abdominal tenderness," which could be seen as a lack of clarity in documenting pertinent negatives.

Overall, the documentation is well-organized and includes almost all key findings, but it is slightly lacking in explicitly stating the pertinent negative regarding abdominal tenderness. However, the presence of the other findings is strong and relevant.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: 40 yo male with PMH gout (last acute episode 2 yrs prior, no current pharmacologic management) presenting for acute sharp intermittent right flank pain that started 24 hrs ago, N/V, emesis, dysuria, urinary urgency, and R. CVA tenderness on physical exam. No dietary changes or excessive red meat consumption or constitutional sx. Well appearing, hemodynamically stable
Response: To evaluate the provided sum against the rubric, we first need to identify the essential elements included in the statement.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions that the pain started 24 hours ago, which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement specifies "right flank pain," which meets this requirement.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity is not explicitly stated as 10/10 or severe; thus, this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The pain is described as "sharp intermittent," but does not mention spasms, colic, or waves; therefore, this element is also missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement includes "N/V," which refers to non-bilious vomiting, and "dysuria" and "urinary urgency," which do not count as optional elements in the context of the rubric.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Essential elements present: 2 (acute onset and right flank pain)
- Missing essential elements: 3 (intensity, spasms/colic/waves)
- Total elements: 5 (though some are not essential, they do not exceed the limit)

Based on the rubric:
- The note is missing multiple essential elements (specifically, the intensity and the description of pain type), so it would score a 2.

Final score: 2

1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Gallstones 3. Pyelonephritis 
Response: To evaluate the provided differential diagnosis against the rubric:

1. The first diagnosis, nephrolithiasis, is correct and aligns with the expected findings related to the patient's symptoms.
2. The second diagnosis, gallstones, is not relevant to the symptoms based on the information provided. This indicates a misinterpretation of the findings.
3. The third diagnosis, pyelonephritis, is also correct and consistent with the expected findings.

The inclusion of gallstones introduces a significant flaw in the prioritization and relevance of the differential diagnosis. The correct diagnoses are present, but the incorrect inclusion of gallstones affects the overall consistency with the findings.

Based on this evaluation, the differential diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the findings but includes an irrelevant option and misprioritizes the diagnoses.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis - urinary urgency, dysuria, acute onset (24 hrs), intermittent nature consistent with kidney stones, no constitutional sx, gout hx, mom gallstones/cholecystectomy, No abd pain all 6 quadrants with light/deep palpation. No rigidity or guarding. Well appearing, hemodynamically stable 2. Gallstones - less likely given negative murphy sign, although intermittent nature and gout make for reasonable DDX, Well appearing, hemodynamically stable 3. Pyelo - No constitutional sx makes less likely and given acute onset rather than progressively worsening sx. Pt would likely appear ill. Well appearing, hemodynamically stable
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to assess how well the student supported their diagnoses with relevant patient findings and whether the links made between the findings and the diagnoses are accurate and complete.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The student mentions urinary urgency and dysuria, which are not classic symptoms of nephrolithiasis but could be seen in some cases. However, they correctly note the acute onset, intermittent nature of pain, and the patient's history of gout, which supports the diagnosis. The mention of being well-appearing and hemodynamically stable is appropriate but does not directly support nephrolithiasis. Overall, while there are some inaccuracies, the reasoning is fairly solid, and the links are mostly correct.

2. **Gallstones**: The student acknowledges the negative Murphy's sign, which weakens the likelihood of gallstones. They also mention the intermittent nature and gout as considerations for the differential diagnosis, indicating some thought process. However, the reasoning could be stronger by connecting more explicitly to the patient's symptoms. The assessment of being well-appearing and stable is noted but does not strengthen the case for gallstones.

3. **Pyelonephritis**: The student correctly identifies that the absence of constitutional symptoms makes pyelonephritis less likely and notes that the acute onset rather than progressively worsening symptoms is significant. However, they do not mention any specific findings that would support or negate pyelonephritis beyond general observations of the patient's condition.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is somewhat supported but contains several inaccuracies and lacks some critical links between findings and diagnoses. There is an attempt to justify the reasoning, but it does not fully meet the criteria for a well-supported differential diagnosis. 

Considering these factors, I would score this section as a 2 for weakly supported differential diagnosis with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis.

To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: - CT abd pelvis without contrast (stone protocol) - CBC to examine WBC - UA/dipstick given hematuria/urgency - HIDA scan if negative CT to r/o gallbladder etiology 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we can break down the components against the rubric criteria:

1. **Required Tests**: The rubric specifies a UA as a required test, which is included in the plan.
2. **Acceptable Tests**: The plan includes a CT abdomen/pelvis, which is acceptable according to the rubric, as well as a CBC to examine WBC, which is generally reasonable in the context of evaluating possible infections or other hematological issues.
3. **Unacceptable Tests**: The plan does not include any unacceptable tests such as endoscopy.

However, the plan also includes a HIDA scan if the CT is negative, which could be seen as unnecessary unless there is a strong clinical suspicion for gallbladder issues based on the interview. This could indicate a more extensive workup than necessary, depending on the clinical context.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and acceptable tests but also introduces a potentially unnecessary HIDA scan, which could suggest a reasonable but not optimal approach. 

Based on these considerations, I would score this plan as a 3, as it includes most essential tests but also some unnecessary ones.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Patient is a middle aged M with PMH significant for gout presenting to the ED with a 1 day history of sharp R flank pain radiating to the back. Patient reports the pain had no inciting factors. The pain is sharp and constant at a 2/10 with associated nausea. Every 1-2 hours, patient describes a "spasm" in which his sharp pain is more intense, rating it a 9/10 pain, and associated vomiting. He tried taking Tylenol for the pain but it did not help. He also endorses a 1 day history of urinary frequency, dysuria, and burning sensation in the R groin . He has been able to tolerate PO, though he states he drinks mostly coffee and very little water. Denies fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, gross hematuria, joint pain. Of note, patient reported he did an intense rowing exercise 3 days ago and is concerned it may be related to his pain. He is also concerned about having gallstones, as his mother had them. 14 point ROS otherwise negative except as per HPI. PMH: 1 episodes of acute gout in R big toe, no longer takes medication (unsure what he was on) and has had no further flares FHX: father has DM and HTN, mother has history of gallstones s/p ccy Social: lives at home with wife in lexington, is insurance manager, reports occasional drinking of 1 drink/month, denies tobacco/drug use medications: takes no medications allergies: None
Response: The provided HPI includes several elements, but there are some key omissions and disorganization that affect its overall quality. 

1. The patient does report right flank pain, but the duration is noted as "1 day" instead of the required "x24 hours or acute." 
2. The pain is described as sharp, which is correct, but it is stated as "constant" rather than indicating the presence of spasms or colic every 1-2 hours. The report does mention an increase in pain intensity to 9/10 during "spasms," which aligns with the rubric, but the lack of a clear distinction between constant pain and spasms is somewhat confusing.
3. The severity of pain is indicated correctly with a 9/10 during the spasms.
4. Nausea and vomiting are noted, but the description of the vomiting is missing the specification of it being "clear or nonbloody/nonbilious."
5. The urinary symptoms are documented, including frequency and dysuria, but it does not clearly state "urgency" or that there is "no hematuria," which are pertinent negatives.
6. There are additional details provided about the patient's past medical history, family history, and social history, which are not strictly necessary for the HPI but add context.

Overall, while the HPI contains many relevant details, it misses several key components, particularly regarding the organization of symptoms and the presence of pertinent negatives. Therefore, I would rate this section as follows:

- Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, but it is missing some pertinent negatives and has some disorganization.

Final score: 3

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Patient is a middle aged M with PMH significant for gout presenting to the ED with a 1 day history of sharp R flank pain radiating to the back with associated nausea and vomiting. 
Response: To evaluate the provided statement against the rubric and the answer key, let's break down the essential elements:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions a "1 day history," which implies acute onset. This element is present.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement specifies "sharp R flank pain," so this element is present.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of pain is not explicitly stated as 10/10 or severe. Therefore, this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement does not mention spasms, colic, or waves of pain. This element is also missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement includes "associated nausea and vomiting," which relates to the optional element of non-bilious vomiting. However, it does not mention right groin pain or afebrile status.

Based on this analysis:
- The statement includes 2 essential elements (acute onset and right flank pain).
- It is missing 2 essential elements (intensity and description of pain pattern).
- The total number of elements present is 5 (2 essential + 1 optional + 2 missing).

According to the rubric:
- Since there are multiple essential elements missing, the score would be a 2.

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis, which are both relevant to the symptoms typically associated with urinary issues, such as flank pain or dysuria. The first diagnosis, nephrolithiasis, is particularly pertinent if the patient is experiencing renal colic, which aligns well with common presentations. The second diagnosis, pyelonephritis, is also appropriate if there are signs of infection or systemic symptoms.

There are no additional diagnoses listed that could indicate a broader consideration of other potential issues, such as a muscle strain or inguinal hernia, but the two main diagnoses provided are prioritized correctly based on the commonality and severity of the conditions.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings and reflects a correct interpretation without any major flaws in prioritization that would negatively impact patient care.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis: Patient has a history of gout and is not on medication, which is a risk factor for kidney stones. Additionally, he has characteristic, sharp R flank pain that radiates to the back. The pain is severe and causing nausea/vomiting, which is also suggestive of kidney stones. Kidney stones are also more common in middle aged men and his low water intake is an additional risk factor. 3. Pyelonephritis: Patient has flank and R back tenderness on exam that may also be considered CVA tenderness characteristic of pyelonephritis. Additionally, a long-standing obstruction may lead to this sequale, though I would have expected a longer history of kidney stones/ urinary symptoms preceding the ED visit for it to have already progressed to pyelonephritis. However, it should not be missed and should be evaluated for when doing the U/A for kidney stones. 
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis, both of which are well supported by the patient’s symptoms and history. 

For nephrolithiasis, the response effectively links the patient's history of gout, the acute and severe right flank pain, and associated nausea/vomiting to the diagnosis of kidney stones. The mention of low water intake as an additional risk factor further strengthens the connection.

For pyelonephritis, the identification of right flank and back tenderness as potential costovertebral angle tenderness is a good link to the diagnosis. However, the response acknowledges a potential limitation in the diagnosis due to the lack of longer-standing urinary symptoms, which shows critical thinking about the diagnosis but also introduces a slight uncertainty. Nonetheless, the mention of the need for evaluation through urinalysis indicates a thorough approach to patient care.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported with correct links to the findings, although there are some minor uncertainties regarding the progression to pyelonephritis. This does not significantly detract from the overall quality of the assessment.

Given these points, I would score this section as a 3.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. Focused US of R flank for stone evaluation 2. U/A to look for underlying infection, microscopic hematuria and crystals 3. If stones confirmed, IVF and analgesics until stone passage. 4. given history of gout, if stones are confirmed, patient should follow up with PCP for further evaluation of disease 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan against the rubric, we need to analyze the components of the diagnostic workup:

1. The focused ultrasound of the right flank for stone evaluation is an acceptable test, as it is relevant to the suspected condition (kidney stones).
2. The urinalysis (U/A) is a required test and is included in the plan, addressing potential underlying infection and other relevant findings.
3. The mention of IVF (intravenous fluids) and analgesics is a reasonable management step if stones are confirmed, although it does not directly pertain to the diagnostic workup.
4. The follow-up with the PCP for further evaluation of gout is a reasonable plan but does not directly relate to the immediate diagnostic workup for stones.

Overall, the plan includes the essential U/A and an acceptable focused ultrasound. There are no unnecessary tests included, and the plan is effective and efficient regarding the workup for kidney stones. Therefore, it aligns well with the highest standard of the rubric.

Based on this analysis, the score for the plan for diagnostic workup is:

- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 50yo M with history of gout (last flare 2 years ago) presenting for acute-onset right flank pain. He has had the pain for 1 day and describes it as sharp, 2/10 severity, radiating to the mid-back and right groin. He reports occasional right back spasms every 1-2 hours that last for 2-20 minutes, at which time the pain is a 9/10 severity and he experiences nausea. He has vomited clear mucous twice. The pain has not been relieved with Tylenol. He also reports increased urinary frequency and dysuria, but no hematuria. On ROS, he reports no fever, chills, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, bone pain, or changes in bowel movements. PMH- gout flare 2 years ago FH- father with HTN and DM, mother with gallstones Surgical hx- none SH- denies tobacco and drug use, rare alcohol consumption Allergies- none Medications- none
Response: To evaluate the HPI provided for Nathaniel Ryan, we will compare it against the answer key's requirements. 

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does report right flank pain, which is good.
2. **Duration**: The pain is reported as having lasted for "1 day," which is consistent with "x24 hours or acute."
3. **Character of pain**: The pain is described as "sharp," which matches the key.
4. **Severity**: The patient rates the pain as "2/10," which is significantly lower than the required "9/10" for severe pain, thus a key detail is missing.
5. **Spasms/Colic**: The patient mentions "occasional right back spasms every 1-2 hours" which aligns with the requirement, but the context of spasms leading to severe pain isn't clearly articulated.
6. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient reports nausea and has vomited "clear mucous twice," which matches the requirement for clear or nonbloody/nonbilious.
7. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient reports increased urinary frequency and dysuria, which is documented correctly.
8. **Hematuria**: The patient states there is "no hematuria," which is correct.

Overall, the HPI includes most of the required information, but it notably lacks the correct severity of the flank pain, which is a critical detail, and there are some organization issues with how spasms are connected to the pain. 

Based on the rubric:
- The note includes most key positive historical findings but misses the critical detail of pain severity and has some disorganization in the presentation of spasms.

Thus, I would score this HPI as a 2 for missing key historical findings and having disorganization in the documentation.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals T 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 O2 99% on RA Physical Exam General- well appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress HEENT- normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal and reactive to light, oropharynx clear, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest- normal S1/2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Respiratory- symmetric chest rise, bilateral lung fields clear to auscultation Abdomen- positive bowel sounds, no tenderness to deep palpation, tenderness right flank pain, (+) right CVA tenderness Skin- no bruises/rashes MSK- 5/5 upper and lower extremity strength bilaterally Neuro- alert and oriented Psych- Appropriate mood and behavior
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to identify the presence of key positive findings as well as any pertinent negatives.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are documented as normal, which aligns with the answer key.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The exam notes "tenderness right flank pain" and "(+) right CVA tenderness," indicating that this key finding is present.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note states "no tenderness to deep palpation," which implies that there is no abdominal tenderness, aligning with the answer key.

Now, let's analyze the organization and completeness of the findings:
- The findings are well organized by system and include relevant details.
- All key physical exam findings from the answer key are present.
- There are no irrelevant details that obscure the key findings.

Based on the rubric:
- Since almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise, and well organized with little irrelevant information, this would score a 4.

Final score: 4

3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 50yo M with history of gout presenting to the ED for acute-onset right flank pain and dysuria.
Response: To evaluate Nathaniel Ryan's note against the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements present in his summary statement.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: Present ("acute-onset")
2. **Right flank pain**: Present ("right flank pain")
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: Not present (no intensity mentioned)
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: Not present (no mention of spasms, colic, or wave-like pain)
5. **Optional elements**: "dysuria" is mentioned, but it is not one of the optional elements listed in the answer key.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Two essential elements are present (acute onset and right flank pain).
- Two essential elements are missing (intensity and description of pain).

According to the rubric:
- The note is missing multiple essential elements (specifically, the intensity of the pain and the type of pain).

Based on this evaluation, the score for this section is:

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Pyelonephritis 2. Nephrolithiasis 3. Cystitis
Response: Let's evaluate the provided differential diagnosis against the answer key and rubric criteria.

1. **Pyelonephritis**: This is consistent with the findings as it is one of the conditions listed in the answer key (UTI/pyelonephritis).
2. **Nephrolithiasis**: This is also consistent with the findings as it is directly mentioned in the answer key (nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic).
3. **Cystitis**: While cystitis is related to urinary tract infections, it is not explicitly listed in the answer key. However, it can be considered somewhat relevant as it is a common condition associated with urinary symptoms.

Now, let's analyze the prioritization:
- The top two conditions (pyelonephritis and nephrolithiasis) are prioritized correctly based on the answer key.
- Cystitis, while relevant, is not prioritized as a primary diagnosis in the answer key, which could be seen as a minor flaw.

Given this evaluation:
- The differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings (pyelonephritis and nephrolithiasis) but includes cystitis, which is not explicitly mentioned in the answer key. This indicates a minor flaw in prioritization but does not negatively impact patient care significantly.

Based on the rubric, this would align with a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Pyelonephritis- acute-onset flank pain, dysuria and urinary frequency, CVA tenderness on exam 2. Nephrolithiasis- acute-onset flank pain, dysuria and urinary frequency, fever is low-grade; however, CVA tenderness is present 3. Cystitis- increased urinary frequency and dysuria with fever; however, pain is lateralized to the right and he has CVA tenderness
Response: The provided differential diagnoses include pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, and cystitis. 

1. **Pyelonephritis**: The reasoning includes acute-onset flank pain and mentions dysuria and urinary frequency. However, there is no mention of CVA tenderness on exam, which is a crucial finding for pyelonephritis. Therefore, while the link to flank pain is appropriate, the absence of CVA tenderness is a significant gap.

2. **Nephrolithiasis**: The reasoning discusses acute-onset flank pain and includes dysuria and urinary frequency, which are relevant findings. The presence of low-grade fever and CVA tenderness is also noted, which supports nephrolithiasis. This diagnosis is well-supported, linking symptoms correctly to the diagnosis.

3. **Cystitis**: The reasoning mentions increased urinary frequency and dysuria with fever, which are consistent with cystitis. However, the note about pain being lateralized to the right and the presence of CVA tenderness is contradictory, as CVA tenderness would typically not be present in a straightforward case of cystitis. This weakens the support for cystitis as a differential.

Overall, the differential diagnoses presented have some appropriate links, but there are gaps in the support for pyelonephritis and cystitis, particularly concerning CVA tenderness. The differential diagnosis is somewhat supported but contains inaccuracies that could mislead clinical decision-making.

Given the presence of some well-supported links but also several inaccuracies and omissions, I would assign a score of 2 for weakly supported differential diagnosis with several incorrect links.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. CBC for infection 2. CMP for electrolyte abnormalities and determine if an AKI is present 3. UA and urine culture for infection 4. Renal ultrasound to look for fat stranding/inflammation
Response: To evaluate the provided plan against the rubric, we can break down the proposed diagnostic workup:

1. **CBC for infection** - This test is not listed in the required or acceptable tests, and while it may provide some useful information, it does not directly address the essential requirements of the plan.
2. **CMP for electrolyte abnormalities and determine if an AKI is present** - The CMP is not specifically listed as required or acceptable, but it can be relevant for assessing renal function and electrolyte balance. However, its necessity should be reconsidered in the context of the required tests.
3. **UA and urine culture for infection** - This test is required and is appropriately included in the plan.
4. **Renal ultrasound to look for fat stranding/inflammation** - This is listed as an acceptable test and is relevant for assessing renal issues.

Overall, while the plan includes the required UA and an acceptable renal ultrasound, it also includes unnecessary tests (CBC and CMP), which detracts from its effectiveness. The presence of some acceptable tests along with unnecessary ones indicates a reasonable plan, but it is not fully efficient.

Based on this analysis, the scoring aligns with option 3 from the rubric: a reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: 40 year old male with past history of gout, presenting for flank pain, nausea, vomiting, over the last 24 hours. Increased urinary urgency and intermittent waves of pain. Some burning with urination. Pain is so severe that has caused nausea and vomiting. No fevers. Has tried acetaminophen to no relief. No diarrhea or constipation. No blood in urine. Lives at home with wife. No surgical history. Mother had gallstones and had a cholecystectomy. Father with DM and HTN.
Response: The provided HPI includes several key components but also has some omissions and disorganization. 

1. **Right flank pain**: Mentioned but lacks specific detail about the duration (24 hours) and the quality (sharp).
2. **Pain characteristics**: The description of pain as "intermittent waves" does not clearly indicate the severity or the presence of spasms/colic, which is a key detail.
3. **Nausea and vomiting**: Present, but it does not specify that the vomiting is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious.
4. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: Urgency is mentioned, but the burning sensation is noted without explicitly stating dysuria.
5. **No hematuria**: Clearly documented, which is good.
6. **Additional details**: While the family history and surgical history are included, they are not relevant to the HPI of the current symptoms.

Overall, the HPI is somewhat organized but lacks critical details and has some irrelevant information. The patient’s history is not fully aligned with the key points in the rubric.

Given these considerations, I would assign a score of 2.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: T 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 99% RA PERRL, EOMI MMM, dentition intact, throat minor erythema LCTAB RRR, no murmurs, rubs, gallops. Pulses 2+ radial, PT, No abdominal tenderness. No guarding. No rebound. Negative Rovsing, negative McBurney. Right-sided Flank pain. Strength 5/5 upper, 5/5 lower No skin lesions
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we first identify the key components that should be included based on the answer key:

1. Normal vitals (which are provided: T 99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, 99% RA)
2. Positive costovertebral angle tenderness (not clearly documented; "Right-sided Flank pain" is noted, but it's not explicitly stated as costovertebral angle tenderness)
3. No abdominal tenderness (documented as "No abdominal tenderness," which is correct)

Now, let's analyze the findings provided:

- The vital signs are normal and well documented.
- There is mention of "Right-sided Flank pain," which could imply costovertebral angle tenderness, but it does not explicitly state it, which is a key omission based on the answer key.
- The note correctly states "No abdominal tenderness," which aligns with the answer key.

The organization of the findings is generally clear, and while there is a minor omission regarding the costovertebral angle tenderness, the majority of the key findings are present and logically arranged.

Given the rubric:
- The presence of normal vitals and the clear documentation of no abdominal tenderness are positive aspects.
- The omission of the explicit mention of costovertebral angle tenderness is significant but does not detract from the overall organization and clarity of the note.

Considering these factors, I would assess this section as scoring a 3, as it contains most key findings but is missing a pertinent negative (the explicit mention of costovertebral angle tenderness).

3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nate Ryan is a 40 year old Male with 24 hours of recurring flank pain, dysuria, nausea, and vomiting.
Response: To evaluate the provided summary based on the rubric and answer key, let's break down the essential elements:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The note states "24 hours of recurring flank pain," which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The note mentions "flank pain," but does not specify that it is on the right side. This means this essential element is missing.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: There is no mention of the intensity of the pain, so this essential element is also missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The note does not mention any of these descriptors for the pain, so this element is missing as well.
5. **Optional elements**: The note includes "nausea" and "vomiting," which are optional and relevant but do not contribute to the scoring of essential elements.

Based on the evaluation:
- Missing multiple essential elements (specifically, elements 2, 3, and 4).
- The summary does not include a complete set of required elements.

Thus, according to the rubric, this would score as follows:

2

2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: Nephrolithiasis Pyelonephritis
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is a correct interpretation of findings, especially if the symptoms suggest renal colic or associated pain.
2. Pyelonephritis is also a relevant differential diagnosis, particularly if there are urinary symptoms or fever present.

However, the list is missing a third potential diagnosis that could be considered based on the symptoms, such as a UTI, which is typically relevant when discussing renal issues and could be prioritized before pyelonephritis depending on the context. 

Overall, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings, but the lack of a broader consideration (like a UTI) and the prioritization of only two diagnoses reflects a minor flaw. This would not negatively impact patient care significantly, as nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis are both serious considerations.

Given these points, I would score this differential diagnosis as a 3.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: Nephrolith. Intermittent waves of severe pain, increased urinary urgency. Some nausea and vomiting from pain. Pyelo - less likely as afebrile and acute onset
Response: Based on the provided information and the scoring rubric, the differential diagnosis presented includes nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) as the primary diagnosis, supported by the description of intermittent waves of severe pain and increased urinary urgency, along with some nausea and vomiting. 

The mention of pyelonephritis (UTI) is addressed but deemed less likely due to the patient being afebrile and the acute onset of symptoms, which is a reasonable rationale. However, the differential diagnosis lacks some completeness, as it does not mention dysuria or urgency associated with UTI, which would strengthen the link. 

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported with correct links to the findings, but there are some missing aspects that would not negatively impact patient care significantly. Therefore, I would score this section as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Ultrasound of kidney - visualize kidney stones if there Urine analysis with microscopy - see what's in his urine CBC - check white count
Response: To evaluate the provided plan against the rubric:

1. **Required Test**: The urine analysis (UA) is included, which is essential.
2. **Acceptable Tests**: The renal ultrasound is acceptable as it can help visualize kidney stones.
3. **Unacceptable Tests**: The CBC (complete blood count) is not listed as an acceptable or required test in the answer key. It may be relevant but is not necessary for the immediate concern of kidney stones.

In this case, the plan includes the required urine analysis and an acceptable ultrasound of the kidney, but it also includes the CBC, which is not necessary for this specific workup. This suggests that the plan is reasonable but includes some unnecessary tests.

Based on the rubric:
- The plan includes most essential tests but also includes some unnecessary tests (the CBC).

Thus, the score for this plan is a 3.

3) Most features are organized with information presented in appropriate sections.
2) Some features are disorganized with information in the incorrect place or repeated and/or occasional sections missing.
1) Most features are disorganized, with appropriate sections missing.. Here is the answer key for org: . Please evaluate the following org and provide a score: History of Present Illness:
40 year old male with past history of gout, presenting for flank pain, nausea, vomiting, over the last 24 hours. Increased urinary urgency and intermittent waves of pain. Some burning with urination. Pain is so severe that has caused nausea and vomiting. No fevers. Has tried acetaminophen to no relief. No diarrhea or constipation. No blood in urine. Lives at home with wife. No surgical history. Mother had gallstones and had a cholecystectomy. Father with DM and HTN.

No rebound. Negative Rovsing, negative McBurney. Right-sided Flank pain. Strength 5/5 upper, 5/5 lower No skin lesions

Summary:
Nate Ryan is a 40 year old Male with 24 hours of recurring flank pain, dysuria, nausea, and vomiting.

Differential Diagnosis:
Nephrolithiasis Pyelonephritis

Supporting Information:
Nephrolith. Intermittent waves of severe pain, increased urinary urgency. Some nausea and vomiting from pain. Pyelo - less likely as afebrile and acute onset

Plan:
Ultrasound of kidney - visualize kidney stones if there Urine analysis with microscopy - see what's in his urine CBC - check white count


Response: The organization of the provided information is relatively clear and follows a logical structure. Each section (History of Present Illness, Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, Plan) is distinctly labeled and contains relevant information pertaining to the patient's condition.

- The History of Present Illness is detailed and provides a concise account of the patient's symptoms and relevant medical history.
- The Physical Examination section is thorough, presenting vital signs and findings in an organized manner.
- The Summary effectively encapsulates the key points of the patient's presentation.
- The Differential Diagnosis is appropriately listed, and the Supporting Information offers rationale for the diagnoses.
- The Plan is clearly outlined with specific tests to be performed.

While the organization is strong, there could be slight improvements in how some sections relate to each other, particularly in the flow from the Physical Examination to the Summary. However, the overall structure is appropriate and adheres to the expected format.

Given this assessment, I would score this section as follows:

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: 45 year old male presenting with right flank pain radiating to the groin and midback for 24 hours. Pain is a constant 2/10 with intermittent episodes of colicky 9/10 pain. Associated symptoms include nausea and vomiting (clear, no bile or blood). He has tried taking Tylenol with no relief. He states he has increased frequency and urgency urinating. He denies hematuria. He has no changes in bowel movements. He does not drink a lot of water, <2 glasses per day. PMH: gout right big toe, 2 years ago SH: 1 shot of liquor or a beer per month, denies tobacco use, denies illicit drug use FH: Mother- gallstones, cholecystectomy; Father- diabetes and hypertension Meds: None Allergies: None 
Response: The provided HPI contains several key pieces of information but also has some omissions and disorganization. 

1. **Right flank pain**: Present and noted as radiating to the groin and midback, which is relevant.
2. **Duration**: Correctly noted as 24 hours, which is good.
3. **Pain description**: The pain is described as constant at 2/10, but there is a mention of intermittent episodes of colicky pain at 9/10. While it captures the severity, it does not clearly state that the pain is sharp, which is part of the key information.
4. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are documented, and the clarity of the vomit is mentioned (clear, no bile or blood), which is appropriate.
5. **Dysuria and urgency**: Increased frequency and urgency are documented, but there is no direct mention of dysuria; however, the context implies it might be present.
6. **Hematuria**: Clearly denied, which is correct.
7. **Other information**: The note includes additional details about past medical history, social history, family history, medications, and allergies, which although informative, could be seen as somewhat irrelevant to the immediate HPI focus.

Overall, while the HPI includes most of the essential elements, it lacks some clarity and direct wording regarding the sharpness of the pain and dysuria. The additional details, while not irrelevant, could distract from the key findings.

Considering these points, I would score this HPI as a 3 since most key positive historical findings are documented and organized, but it misses some pertinent negatives and could be clearer.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp 99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, O2 99% RA Abdominal: positive bowel sounds, no tenderness to palpation, negative Murphys sign GU: Positive right costovertebral tenderness, tenderness to palpation on right flank, negative left costovertebral tenderness 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric:

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are documented, but the temperature is slightly elevated (99.7°F), which may not be considered "normal" in a strict sense. This could be a key finding depending on the context.
  
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The note indicates "positive right costovertebral tenderness," which aligns with the key finding. However, it also mentions "tenderness to palpation on right flank," which could be seen as redundant or excessive detail.

3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note states "no tenderness to palpation," which aligns with the requirement of documenting no abdominal tenderness.

4. **Missing Pertinent Negatives**: There are no documented negative findings for the abdominal exam beyond "no tenderness," which might be considered a lack of thoroughness.

Overall, while the note includes some key physical exam findings, the presence of a slightly elevated temperature and the redundancy in detailing tenderness may detract from the clarity and organization. The absence of some pertinent negatives might also affect the score.

Based on these considerations, I would assign a score of 3, as most key physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but there are some omissions and slight disorganization.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 45 year old male who presents with acute (1) right-sided flank pain (2) radiating to his groin (3) with nausea/ vomiting (4) and fever (5). 
Response: To evaluate Mr. Ryan's summary statement based on the rubric provided, we need to identify the essential elements included in the response and compare them to the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - Present (acute)
2. **Right flank pain** - Present (right-sided flank pain)
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - Not present (intensity is not specified as 10/10 or severe)
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - Not present (pain is described as radiating but not as spasms, colic, or in waves)
5. **Optional elements** - Nausea/vomiting and fever are included, which are optional but not essential.

Based on the evaluation:
- The statement is missing two essential elements (intensity and description of pain). 
- It does include additional optional elements (nausea/vomiting and fever), but these do not count towards fulfilling the essential criteria.

According to the rubric:
- Since multiple essential elements are missing, the score would be a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis 3. UTI
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, and UTI. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is the most relevant diagnosis given the context of kidney-related symptoms, which aligns well with the findings.
2. Pyelonephritis is also a relevant diagnosis, particularly if there are signs of infection or inflammation in the kidneys.
3. UTI is consistent with the symptoms and can often overlap with pyelonephritis.

The differential diagnosis is pertinent and prioritized correctly, as it reflects a logical interpretation of the findings related to the patient's symptoms. However, it does not include the optional diagnoses of muscle strain or inguinal hernia, which could be considered in a broader differential but are not essential based on the provided symptoms.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings and well-prioritized, but it lacks some breadth since it doesn't include optional diagnoses. Therefore, it has minor flaws in prioritization but would not negatively impact patient care.

Based on this assessment, I would score the differential diagnosis as a 3.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis -middle aged male -low fluid intake -right sided flank pain radiating to groin -colicky pain -N/v -fever -pmh: gout - positive right costovertebral and flank tenderness 2. Pyelonephritis - positive right costovertebral tenderness -N/v -fever -right sided flank pain 3. UTI -increased frequency and urgency urinating 
Response: Let's evaluate the differential diagnosis provided:

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The details provided are strong. The patient is described as a middle-aged male with low fluid intake, which is a risk factor for kidney stones. The right-sided flank pain radiating to the groin is consistent with renal colic. The colicky nature of the pain, along with nausea/vomiting and a past medical history of gout, supports this diagnosis well. The mention of positive right costovertebral and flank tenderness adds further support. Overall, this section is well-supported and links correctly to the diagnosis.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: The details here are also appropriate. The presence of positive right costovertebral tenderness, nausea/vomiting, fever, and right-sided flank pain aligns with pyelonephritis. However, there is no mention of dysuria or urgency, which are typical symptoms of a urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis. While the links are largely correct, the absence of these common symptoms slightly weakens the overall support.

3. **UTI**: The mention of increased frequency and urgency urinating is relevant to a UTI; however, it lacks the context of flank pain being the primary symptom, which is more indicative of pyelonephritis in this case. The differential diagnosis does not connect strongly to the other symptoms presented.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported for nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis, but the UTI section is less robust. The links to the diagnoses are mostly correct and complete, but with minor weaknesses in the UTI section.

Based on the rubric:
- Nephrolithiasis: Excellent support
- Pyelonephritis: Appropriately supported, but missing some common symptoms
- UTI: Weakly supported

The overall score falls between 2 and 3, leaning towards 3 due to the strong support for nephrolithiasis and adequate support for pyelonephritis.

Final score: 3

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CT abdomen and pelvis, no contrast Urinalysis Pelvic exam 
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we see the following components:

1. **CT abdomen and pelvis** - This is an acceptable test according to the rubric.
2. **Urinalysis (UA)** - This is required and essential.
3. **Pelvic exam** - This is not listed as an acceptable or required test in the answer key and does not align with the necessary components for the diagnostic workup.

The plan includes the essential urinalysis and an acceptable CT scan, but it also includes a pelvic exam, which is not justified based on the rubric. This makes the plan somewhat reasonable but includes unnecessary tests.

Given that the plan includes most essential tests but also an unnecessary one (the pelvic exam), it aligns with the description for a score of 3.

Final score: 3

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: - Presenting with acute, right-sided flank pain that started in the last 24 hours - Intermittent sharp, spasms, radiating to the groin that can last for up to 20 minutes - Rates the pain as 9/10 - Associated with nausea vomiting - Patient has noticed increased urinary urgency and a burning pain with urination - Tylenol has not helped with pain ROS: denies fever, chills, chest pain, SOA, constipation, diarrhea, frank blood in urine PMHx - Hx of gout (2 years ago) Meds - none Surgeries - none Allergies - none SH - works at insurance company, desk job; well-balanced diet. Denies smoking and drug use. Infrequent EtOH use FH - mother had gallstone
Response: The provided HPI includes several key components that are relevant to the patient's presenting symptoms. Here’s the breakdown based on the rubric:

1. **Right flank pain**: Present and described as acute, which aligns with the key information.
2. **Duration**: The pain started in the last 24 hours, which is accurate.
3. **Quality**: The pain is described as intermittent sharp spasms radiating to the groin, which is somewhat aligned with the expected description of colic.
4. **Severity**: The patient rates the pain as 9/10, which is included.
5. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are mentioned, but the detail about the nature of the vomiting (clear or nonbloody/nonbilious) is missing.
6. **Dysuria and urgency**: These symptoms are present, and the burning pain with urination is noted, but the specific detail regarding hematuria (denying it) is not explicitly stated.
7. **Pertinent negatives**: The ROS denies several symptoms, which is good, but it does not include the specific mention of hematuria.

Based on the above evaluation:
- The HPI contains most of the key historical findings but misses some pertinent negatives (specifically about the nature of the vomiting and the denial of hematuria).
- The organization of the information is generally good, but the omission of specific details reduces clarity.

Thus, I would assess this HPI as deserving a score of 3, as it contains most of the key positive findings but lacks some pertinent negatives.

To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: 99.7F, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, O2 99% on RA HEENT: PERRL, EOM intact, oropharynx wet w/o erythema Nodes: No LAD Lungs: clear lungs sounds b/l CV: regular rate and rhythm, pulses 2+ in upper and lower extremities, no LE edema Abdomen: RUQ, LUQ, RLQ, LLQ, Epigastric and periumbilical regions non-tender to palpation, normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Costovertebral angle tenderness appreciated on right-flank on exam; left-flank was non-tender Neuro: UE and LE 5/5 strength intact; gait intact
Response: The provided physical exam findings include normal vital signs and detailed examinations of various systems. However, while most key positive findings are documented, the pertinent negative findings are not explicitly stated. For instance, it mentions "no abdominal tenderness," which is a pertinent negative, but the organization could be improved by clearly delineating positive from negative findings.

Overall, the documentation is mostly well organized and contains relevant information, but the absence of some pertinent negatives and the lack of clarity in organization prevent it from achieving a higher score.

Based on the rubric, this would score a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 40 year old man that presents with acute onset right-sided flank pain w/ associated nausea/vomiting and dysuria. 
Response: To evaluate Nathaniel Ryan's summary statement against the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements from the answer key and see how many are present in his statement.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - Present (acute onset)
2. **Right flank pain** - Present (right-sided flank pain)
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - Not explicitly mentioned; the intensity of pain is not provided.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - Not mentioned.
5. **Optional elements** - Nausea/vomiting is mentioned, which is an optional element.

Now, let's tally the results:
- Present: 2 essential elements (acute onset, right flank pain)
- Missing: 2 essential elements (intensity, spasms/colic)
- Optional element present: nausea/vomiting

According to the rubric:
- Missing multiple essential elements results in a score of 2.

Thus, the final score is:
2

2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis
Response: The differential diagnosis presented includes nephrolithiasis (kidney stone) and pyelonephritis (UTI). Both conditions are relevant and consistent with common findings related to urinary symptoms such as flank pain, hematuria, and dysuria, which could be inferred from the patient's symptoms. The prioritization of nephrolithiasis as the first option is appropriate, as it is often a more acute concern compared to pyelonephritis, which can be considered a secondary diagnosis. 

Since the differential diagnosis is pertinent and prioritized correctly, reflecting a good interpretation of the findings, it aligns with the criteria for a score of 4.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis - right flank pain on exam, dysuria, intermittent colicky pain is characteristic of kidney stones 2. Pyelonephritis - also associated with flank pain, dysuria; however, fever and signs of infection would be expected which makes it less likely 
Response: The provided support for the differential diagnosis includes:

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The student correctly identifies right flank pain and intermittent colicky pain as characteristic of kidney stones. However, the mention of dysuria is not typically a primary symptom of nephrolithiasis, as it usually relates more to urinary tract infections. The explanation is generally strong but could be more precise in linking the symptomatology.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: The student acknowledges that flank pain and dysuria are associated with pyelonephritis, which is accurate. They also note that fever and signs of infection would be expected, which is a good consideration for ruling it out. However, the absence of those signs in the patient's presentation makes this link weaker.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported with good reasoning, although there are some inaccuracies in linking symptoms to nephrolithiasis and a lack of complete information regarding the patient's presentation for pyelonephritis. Thus, while the student demonstrates an understanding of the conditions, the links could be clearer and more accurate.

Given this analysis, I would score this section as a 3, as it is appropriately supported but has some missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. CT Abdomen Pelvis w/o IV or PO contrast to evaluate presence of stone 2. Urinalysis and UCx to evaluate for signs of infection 3. CBC to see look for signs of systemic infection
Response: Let's evaluate the provided plan against the rubric and the answer key.

1. The first test is a CT abdomen/pelvis, which is acceptable as it is aimed at evaluating the presence of a stone.
2. The second test, urinalysis and urine culture (UA and UCx), is required and appropriate for evaluating signs of infection.
3. The third test, CBC (Complete Blood Count), while it can be useful to look for signs of systemic infection, is not listed as an essential test in the answer key. However, it may still be considered reasonable in this context, but it is not explicitly required.

Now, let's consider the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the plan:
- The plan includes the required UA and an acceptable CT abdomen/pelvis.
- The inclusion of the CBC, while not essential, does not make the plan ineffective, but it does introduce some unnecessary testing.

Based on this evaluation:
- The plan includes most essential tests (UA and CT) and adds one unnecessary test (CBC). Thus, it fits the description of a reasonable plan for diagnostic workup.

Therefore, I would score this plan as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan , birthday 01/30/1983, is here in the ED due to 24 hours of random sharp right flank pain that radiates to the groin. Patient states he was at work sitting at a desk when it first happened. When pain is present, it lasts anywhere from a few minutes to 20 minutes. He states the pain can get up to a 9/10. Pt states the pain is so severe that it has caused him to be nauseous and vomit twice. He has also noticed a increase in urgency with urinating as well as burning when he pees. Patient denies blood in urine or extremely dark pee. Patient has taken acetaminophen which did not really help with symptoms. Patient's appetite and hydration has been okay. Denies, fever, chills, change in bowel movements. Patient denies any pain right now. Patient states his mom had to have a cholecystectomy and is worried this could be his gallbladder. PMH: Gout. no recent flares. Patient denies past surgical history, daily medications, allergies. Family history: Cholecystectomy in mother, diabetes and hypertension in father Social history: Drinks maybe once a month, denies tobacco use, denies recreational drug use. 
Response: The provided HPI includes several key elements but also has some omissions and disorganization that affects clarity. 

1. **Right flank pain:** The patient reports "sharp right flank pain" which is a key finding, but the description lacks specificity regarding the duration being "24 hours" as a clear statement at the beginning.
2. **Pain characteristics:** The pain is described as "random" and radiating to the groin, which is somewhat relevant but doesn't directly align with the rubric's requirement for "spasms or colic every 1-2 hours." The duration of pain episodes is mentioned (from "a few minutes to 20 minutes"), but the frequency is not clearly articulated.
3. **Severity of pain:** The patient states the pain can get up to "9/10," which is documented correctly.
4. **Nausea and vomiting:** The patient mentions nausea and vomiting, specifying that the vomit is "nonbloody/nonbilious," which aligns well with the rubric.
5. **Dysuria and urgency:** The patient reports an increase in urgency with urination and burning, which is relevant but lacks the term "dysuria." The patient denies hematuria, which is correctly noted.
6. **Additional history:** Other relevant historical findings are included, such as the denial of fever, chills, and changes in bowel movements. However, the organization could be improved to clearly separate symptoms from other historical information.

Overall, while most key findings are present, there are some omissions and disorganization that obscure the key elements. Therefore, I would rate this HPI as a 3, as it documents most key findings but misses some pertinent negatives and has some disorganization.

3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 40 year old male who presents with acute right flank pain that radiates to groin, associated with vomiting and dysuria. 
Response: To evaluate the provided statement based on the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements present in the summary and compare them to the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The phrase "acute right flank pain" indicates acute onset.
2. **Right flank pain**: This is explicitly mentioned as "right flank pain."
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity is not specified as "10/10" or "severe," so this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: There is no mention of spasms, colic, or waves of pain, so this element is also missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement includes "vomiting" and "dysuria," but dysuria is not part of the optional elements listed in the rubric.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Present: 1. Acute onset, 2. Right flank pain
- Missing: 3. Intensity, 4. Spasms/colic/waves
- Total elements present: 2 essential elements.

According to the rubric:
- The student is missing multiple essential elements (specifically, elements 3 and 4).

Therefore, the score for this summary statement is:

2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Kidney Stone 2. UTI 
Response: The provided differential diagnoses include "Kidney Stone" and "UTI," which align well with the key provided in the answer key. 

1. "Kidney Stone" corresponds directly to "nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic," which is the first item on the answer key. This indicates a correct interpretation of the findings related to the patient's symptoms.
  
2. "UTI" is also included in the answer key as "UTI/pyelonephritis," which again shows a correct understanding of the patient's potential conditions.

Both diagnoses are relevant and prioritized correctly, as they reflect a clear understanding of common conditions that could explain the patient's symptoms based on the information provided.

Since the differential diagnoses are consistent with the findings and correctly prioritized without any major flaws, I would score this section as a 4.

- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Kidney Stone: Supported by acute, random, shark right flank pain that radiates to groin. Pain is 9/10 which can cause n/v. Dysuria and urgency supported by stone as well. Vitals are reassuring. 2 UTI with potential pyelo. Patient does have dysuria with increase in urgency associated with right flank pain. UTI is uncommon in males however, the nausea and vomiting makes less sense in this case. Furthermore, if the UTI has reached his kidney causing unilateral flank pain, which again does not seem likely for this diagnosis, the vitals would not be as benign.
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided:

1. **Kidney Stone**: The student has identified the right flank pain as acute, sharp, and severe (9/10), which aligns well with the characteristics of nephrolithiasis. The mention of nausea and vomiting is appropriate as these symptoms commonly accompany kidney stones. However, the student incorrectly links dysuria and urgency to kidney stones, which are more characteristic of a UTI. This misinterpretation weakens the support for this diagnosis, but the overall description is still strong.

2. **UTI with potential pyelonephritis**: The student correctly identifies the right flank pain and associates it with dysuria and increased urgency. However, they acknowledge that UTI is uncommon in males, which is a valid point. The student also notes that the benign vitals would not typically support a diagnosis of pyelonephritis, which adds depth to their reasoning. However, the reasoning could be clearer about how the symptoms align or don't align with UTI or pyelonephritis.

Overall, while the student provides a reasonable differential diagnosis, there are several incorrect links (e.g., linking dysuria to kidney stones, and the reasoning about UTI/pyelonephritis could be more robust). The differential diagnosis is appropriately supported but has missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care significantly.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as a 3.

1. The plan includes a UA, which is necessary to rule out a UTI and is considered an essential test.
2. The non-contrast CT is an acceptable test to evaluate for kidney stones.
3. The CBC, while it may provide information about leukocytosis, is not listed as an essential or acceptable test in the answer key. It doesn't directly align with the required tests for the specific symptoms being evaluated (i.e., kidney stones or UTI).

Considering these points, the plan includes essential tests (UA and non-contrast CT) but also includes an unnecessary test (CBC). Therefore, it falls into the category of a reasonable plan for diagnostic workup that includes most essential tests but also some unnecessary tests.

Based on the rubric, this would warrant a score of 3.

I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All features are organized, with information presented in appropriate sections.
3) Most features are organized with information presented in appropriate sections.
2) Some features are disorganized with information in the incorrect place or repeated and/or occasional sections missing.
1) Most features are disorganized, with appropriate sections missing.. Here is the answer key for org: . Please evaluate the following org and provide a score: History of Present Illness:
Mr. Ryan , birthday 01/30/1983, is here in the ED due to 24 hours of random sharp right flank pain that radiates to the groin. Patient states he was at work sitting at a desk when it first happened. When pain is present, it lasts anywhere from a few minutes to 20 minutes. He states the pain can get up to a 9/10. Pt states the pain is so severe that it has caused him to be nauseous and vomit twice. He has also noticed a increase in urgency with urinating as well as burning when he pees. Patient denies blood in urine or extremely dark pee. Patient has taken acetaminophen which did not really help with symptoms. Patient's appetite and hydration has been okay. Denies, fever, chills, change in bowel movements. Patient denies any pain right now. Patient states his mom had to have a cholecystectomy and is worried this could be his gallbladder. PMH: Gout. no recent flares. Patient denies past surgical history, daily medications, allergies. Family history: Cholecystectomy in mother, diabetes and hypertension in father Social history: Drinks maybe once a month, denies tobacco use, denies recreational drug use. 

Physical Examination:
T 99.7 F, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, O2 99% ENT: Moist mucus membranes Cardio: Normal rate and rhythm, no murmurs, normal capillary refill Respiratory: Clear lung sounds Abdominal Exam: Normal bowel sounds, no distension, no tenderness to palpation (light and deep) in all 6 quadrants Back: With light palpation of bilateral flanks, patient denies pain. When accessing for CV tenderness, patient jumped when right pain was tapped with fist over hand. Skin: No jaundice or rashes Neuro: Orientated X3, normal gait 

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a 40 year old male who presents with acute right flank pain that radiates to groin, associated with vomiting and dysuria. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Kidney Stone 2. UTI 

Supporting Information:
1. Kidney Stone: Supported by acute, random, shark right flank pain that radiates to groin. Pain is 9/10 which can cause n/v. Dysuria and urgency supported by stone as well. Vitals are reassuring. 2 UTI with potential pyelo. Patient does have dysuria with increase in urgency associated with right flank pain. UTI is uncommon in males however, the nausea and vomiting makes less sense in this case. Furthermore, if the UTI has reached his kidney causing unilateral flank pain, which again does not seem likely for this diagnosis, the vitals would not be as benign.

Plan:
To evaluate for kidney stones, a non-contrast CT. To rule out a UTI, a UA would be necessary. CBC to make sure there is no leukocytosis. 


Response: The organization of the provided note is quite clear and follows a logical structure. Each section is clearly delineated and contains relevant information pertaining to the patient's history, physical examination findings, summary, differential diagnosis, supporting information, and plan. 

- The **History of Present Illness (HPI)** is detailed, including the patient's symptoms, their onset, duration, severity, and associated factors. 
- The **Physical Examination** section is well-organized, presenting vital signs and findings in a systematic manner.
- The **Summary** succinctly encapsulates the patient's primary complaint and relevant details.
- The **Differential Diagnosis** is clearly listed, with supporting information that logically connects the symptoms to the possible conditions.
- The **Plan** is straightforward and addresses the necessary evaluations.

Overall, the features are well-organized, and the information is presented in appropriate sections without any apparent disorganization or missing sections.

Based on the rubric provided, I would score this organization as follows:

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr ryan is a middle aged male presenting to the ED today with Right flank pain for the last day. He describes that he has sharp flank pain that occurs in increments of 2-20 minutes every hour, which sometimes radiates to the groin. He has tried tylenol, without resolution of sx and reports that he has difficulties staying still when he has the pain. He has also had multiple episodes of vomiting, due to the pain. Mr. Ryan denies changes in urine coloration, however he has had some dysuria and frequency. He also denies fevers, recent trauma to his abdomen or back, blood in his urine, or changes in his diet. In general, Mr. Ryan reports that he is a healthy individual, he does not drink alcohol, smoke or use tobacco, use illicit drugs. He is currently sexually active with his wife of many years. He considers himself to have a healthy diet, full of vegetables, some meats, and 4-5 glasses of water per day, with 1 soda per day. Of note, he joined a gym 3 days ago and spent about 30 minutes on the row machine, which he feels may be related to his pain. PMH- gout, last exacerbation 1 year ago, treated with NSAIDs with complete resolution PShx - none FHx - mother had gallstones and he is worried that this may be the same Meds - none Allergies - none ROS: 15 point ROS negative, except as stated in HPI
Response: In evaluating Mr. Ryan's HPI based on the provided rubric, we can identify the following points:

1. **Key Information Present**: The HPI includes right flank pain as the primary symptom, which is acute (24 hours). The description of the pain as sharp is included, but the frequency of spasms or colic is not accurately represented; it states "increments of 2-20 minutes every hour," which does not align with the expected "every 1-2 hours." The severity of the pain is mentioned but not quantified on a scale of 1-10.

2. **Nausea and Vomiting**: The patient reports multiple episodes of vomiting, which is described as being due to pain, but the specifics regarding the nature of the vomit (clear, nonbloody/nonbilious) are not provided.

3. **Dysuria and Urgency**: Dysuria and frequency are mentioned, but there is no clear statement about urgency. The absence of hematuria is noted, which is a pertinent negative.

4. **Organization and Relevance**: The note is mostly organized, but there are some irrelevant details about the patient's lifestyle that could distract from the key symptoms. 

Overall, while Mr. Ryan's HPI includes several key points, it lacks some critical details regarding the pain's severity, the nature of the vomiting, and the urgency associated with dysuria. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for a higher score.

Given these considerations, I would assign a score of 2 for this HPI.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: 99.7F, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, 99% on RA General - Pt appears uncomfortable, constantly shifting in his bed HEENT - EOMI, PERRLA, moist mucus membranes, no scleral icterus, thyroid nonpalpable, no cervical LAD Cardio - RRR, no MRG Resp - CTAB Abdominal - no pain to palpation in all quadrants to superficial or deep pressure, bowel sounds present GU - Pain to with percussion to right flank. Does not radiate MSK - no pain to palpation of paraspinal muscles. No pain with straight leg test (-) Neuro - Strength 5/5 bilaterally, normal gait
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to assess the completeness, organization, and relevance of the documented findings.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are reported clearly and are normal, which is essential.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: This is noted as "Pain to with percussion to right flank," indicating a positive finding, which aligns with the key finding.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note states "no pain to palpation in all quadrants to superficial or deep pressure," which satisfies the requirement of documenting no abdominal tenderness.

Overall, the physical exam findings are well organized, concise, and include all key findings from the answer key. There are no irrelevant details, and the pertinent negatives are clearly documented.

Considering these points, I would assign a score of 4, as almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise, and well organized with little irrelevant information.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Overall, Mr. Ryan is a middle-aged male presenting to the ED with one day of right flank pain and dysuria. Upon exam, Mr. ryan has significant tenderness to percussion of the right flank and appears to be uncomfortable in his bed and shifts a lot, due to pain. Otherwise, he is stable, does not appear to be dehydrated. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary against the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements included in the statement and compare them to the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "one day" of right flank pain, which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: This is explicitly mentioned in the statement.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The statement does not specify the intensity of the pain as 10/10 or severe, which is a missing element.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement does not include any mention of spasms, colic, or waves of pain, which is another missing element.

The optional elements are not required for scoring but can enhance the overall understanding of the patient's condition. However, they do not affect the score based on the rubric.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- The statement includes the acute onset and right flank pain.
- It is missing the intensity of the pain and the description of the pain pattern (spasms, colic, or waves).

Based on the rubric:
- The summary has 2 essential elements present and is missing 2 essential elements.

According to the scoring criteria:
- This would fall under "2) Missing multiple essential elements."

Final score: 2

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Kidney stone 2. UTI with pyelonephritis 3. Lumbar muscle strain
Response: To evaluate the provided differential diagnosis against the answer key, we can analyze each component:

1. **Kidney stone**: This aligns perfectly with the first item in the answer key (nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic). It is a relevant and prioritized diagnosis based on possible symptoms.

2. **UTI with pyelonephritis**: This is consistent with the second item in the answer key (UTI/pyelonephritis), indicating that the student correctly identified this condition as a potential diagnosis.

3. **Lumbar muscle strain**: This is not included in the answer key. While it could be a reasonable consideration given some symptoms related to back pain, it does not match the prioritized differential diagnoses provided in the answer key.

Overall, the first two items in the differential diagnosis are consistent with the findings and prioritized correctly. The inclusion of the lumbar muscle strain introduces a minor flaw, as it is not part of the key diagnoses.

Based on the rubric:
- The differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings (first two items) but includes a minor flaw (the third item) that would not significantly impact patient care.

Therefore, I would score this submission as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Kidney stone is #1 on ddx. He is having right flank pain, described radiation to the groin classic for this condition. He also has a history of gout. Although he has had no recent flares, it is possible to have uric acid stone formation without acute flares. Additionally, his appearance of pain with psychomotor agitation is classic for kidney stone. With Mr Ryan recent rowing activity, it is also possible that he has a component of rhabdomyolysis. This would show as hematuria without RBC on urine, but is less likely. 2. UTI with pyelonephritis is much less likely. Mr. Ryan denies fevers, new sexual partners, or penile discharge. However it is important to consider pyelonephritis in this patient, due to the acute flank pain and pain with percussion of flank. 3. Lumbar muscle strain is also much less likely. Mr. Ryan believes this could be possible, based on his recent membership at a new gym. However, he denies paraspinal muscle tenderness and had a negative straight leg test. 
Response: The differential diagnosis presented is primarily focused on kidney stones, which is correctly identified as the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The rationale provided includes relevant symptomatology such as right flank pain radiating to the groin, along with the patient's history of gout, which supports the possibility of uric acid stone formation. The mention of psychomotor agitation as a classic sign of kidney stones adds depth to the reasoning.

The second diagnosis, UTI/pyelonephritis, is acknowledged but correctly deemed less likely due to the absence of key symptoms such as fever and other urinary symptoms. However, the reasoning for considering pyelonephritis could be further strengthened by mentioning more about the costovertebral angle tenderness, which is a significant factor in the diagnosis.

The third diagnosis, lumbar muscle strain, is appropriately discussed. The reasoning for its lower likelihood is sound, as the patient denies tenderness and has a negative straight leg raise test, which supports the conclusion.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well supported. The links between the findings and the diagnoses are mostly correct and complete, although there are minor areas where additional detail could enhance the clarity of the reasoning (e.g., more emphasis on costovertebral angle tenderness for pyelonephritis). 

Given these considerations, I would assign a score of 3 for this differential diagnosis.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. collect UA with culture - planning to see hematuria, without casts, with possible stone components 2. Renal / bladder US - to assess for urinary incontinence, renal cyst, or hydronephrosis - if there is a stone >5mm may consider consult to urology for intervention 3. Provide pain control with morphine 10mg q4hr 4. Provide increased hydration with 0.9% IVF
Response: Let's evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup based on the rubric criteria:

1. The plan includes a UA with culture, which is a required test. This is essential for assessing hematuria.
2. A renal/bladder ultrasound is included, which is acceptable for assessing urinary incontinence, renal cyst, or hydronephrosis. It also aligns with the plan to consider intervention if a stone >5mm is found.
3. The plan mentions providing pain control and increased hydration, which, while important for patient care, do not fall under the category of diagnostic tests.
4. There are no unnecessary tests included in the plan, and the tests chosen are relevant to the symptoms presented.

Overall, the plan is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and does not include unnecessary tests. Thus, it meets the criteria for a score of 4.

1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nate Ryan is a 40 year old male who presents with right sided flank pain. He reports the pain started 24 hours ago and is waxing and waning. He says the pain is rated as a 9/10 and describes it as "sharp spasms." He has also been having nausea with vomiting. He also reports symptoms of urinary urgency, denies urinary frequency, and reports dysuria. He denies any signs of hematuria. He says he is also starting to have pain radiating to the groin. He denies any testicular pain or swelling. He has tried Tylenol with no relief. He has never experienced anything like this before. He is tolerating liquids at this point in time. He is concerned for gallstones and has no history of kidney stones. ROS: denies fever, headache, abdominal pain, urinary frequency or hematuria. PMH: episode of gout PSH: none FH: mom has a history of gallstones requiring cholecystectomy Allergies: none Medications: none 
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI (History of Present Illness), we can break down the information as follows:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does mention "right sided flank pain," which is correct, but it should specifically state "right flank pain."
2. **Duration**: The patient reports that the pain started "24 hours ago," which is accurate.
3. **Pain characteristics**: The pain is described as "sharp spasms," which aligns with the key descriptor of "sharp" and indicates spasms, but it does not clearly mention "colic."
4. **Pain severity**: The patient rates the pain as "9/10," which is correct.
5. **Associated symptoms**: The patient has nausea and vomiting, which is documented as "nausea with vomiting." However, it should specify that the vomiting is "clear or nonbloody/nonbilious," which is not mentioned.
6. **Urinary symptoms**: The patient reports "urinary urgency" and "dysuria," but does not mention urinary frequency, which is pertinent. The denial of hematuria is correctly documented.
7. **Additional relevant information**: The patient mentions pain radiating to the groin and denies testicular pain or swelling, which are additional details but not part of the key information listed in the rubric.

Overall, the HPI captures many of the key elements but misses some critical details (e.g., the nature of the vomiting and the omission of urinary frequency). The organization is fairly good, but the additional details about groin pain could be viewed as somewhat irrelevant in the context of the rubric.

Given these points, I would score this HPI as a 3. It includes most of the key positive historical findings but is missing some pertinent negatives and has slight disorganization regarding the vomiting description.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp: 99.7, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/92, O2 99% on room air PE: General: patient appears uncomfortable HEENT: EOMI, no lymphadenopathy Cardio: normal rate and rhythm Abdominal: positive CVA tenderness along the right side, no tenderness to palpation of the paraspinal muscles, negative for suprapubic pain, negative Murphy sign GU: deferred
Response: The provided physical exam findings include:

- Vitals: Temp: 99.7, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/92, O2 99% on room air (which are normal vitals)
- Positive costovertebral angle tenderness (noted in the abdominal section)
- No abdominal tenderness (noted as "no tenderness to palpation of the paraspinal muscles" and "negative for suprapubic pain" and "negative Murphy sign")

The note has the following characteristics:
1. All key physical exam findings are present: normal vitals, positive CVA tenderness, and no abdominal tenderness.
2. The information is organized under appropriate headings (General, HEENT, Cardio, Abdominal, GU).
3. There is little irrelevant information, although the GU section is noted as "deferred," which may not add significant value.

The note is concise and well organized, with all key findings documented appropriately. 

Based on the rubric, the score would be a 4 because almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise, and well organized with little irrelevant information.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nate Ryan is a 40 year old male with no major medical problems who presents with 24 hours of colicky right flank pain radiating to the groin, accompanied by dysuria and urinary urgency. 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided summary based on the rubric and the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "24 hours," which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement mentions "right flank pain," which meets this requirement.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The statement does not specify the intensity of the pain, so this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement describes the pain as "colicky," which fulfills this requirement.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement mentions "dysuria and urinary urgency," but does not include non-bilious vomiting or right groin pain.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- The summary includes 4 total elements: acute onset (24 hours), right flank pain, colicky nature of the pain, and additional symptoms (dysuria and urinary urgency).
- It is missing the intensity of the pain (10/10 or severe), which is an essential element.

According to the rubric:
- The summary has 4 elements (which is 5 or fewer total elements).
- It is missing 1 essential element (the intensity of the pain).

Thus, the score based on the rubric would be a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. Both of these conditions are relevant and consistent with potential findings related to urinary symptoms, such as flank pain or dysuria, which could indicate kidney stones or a urinary tract infection leading to pyelonephritis.

1. Nephrolithiasis is a strong candidate based on common symptoms that align with such a diagnosis, and it is correctly prioritized as a primary concern.
2. Pyelonephritis is also a relevant condition that could arise from a UTI, making it a reasonable secondary diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis presented is pertinent and reflects a good understanding of the potential conditions based on the findings. There are no major flaws in prioritization, and the two diagnoses selected are appropriate for the symptoms that were likely discussed in the interview.

Therefore, I would score this section as a 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis: the pain is colicky, comes and goes, is a 9/10 accompanied by dysuria and urinary urgency. Positive CVA tenderness. Pain radiating to the groin, also described as sharp spasms. Patient is afebrile. 2. Pyelonephritis: positive CVA tenderness, urinary urgency and dysuria present. Patient is afebrile at this time making this less likely. Pain is colicky in nature, more consistent with a stone. 
Response: In evaluating the differential diagnosis presented, the student has provided a well-supported rationale for nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) by detailing the characteristics of the pain (colicky, sharp, severe 9/10), the presence of dysuria and urinary urgency, and the positive costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness. However, the inclusion of dysuria and urinary urgency when discussing nephrolithiasis is inaccurate since these symptoms are more characteristic of a UTI or pyelonephritis. 

The student also appropriately recognized the likelihood of pyelonephritis but correctly pointed out that the patient being afebrile makes this diagnosis less likely. This demonstrates an understanding of the clinical implications of the symptoms.

Overall, while the student presents a strong differential diagnosis for nephrolithiasis, the incorrect linking of dysuria and urinary urgency to nephrolithiasis detracts from the overall support. However, the analysis of pyelonephritis is accurate and appropriately contextualized.

Given these considerations, I would rate the differential diagnosis as appropriately supported but with some incorrect links that would not significantly impact patient care.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. CT without contrast of the abdomen 2. Urine analysis and culture 3. CBC
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we will compare it against the rubric criteria and the answer key.

1. **CT without contrast of the abdomen** - This test is acceptable according to the rubric.
2. **Urine analysis and culture** - This is a required test and is essential for the workup.
3. **CBC (Complete Blood Count)** - While this is a common test, it is not listed as required or acceptable in the answer key, making it an unnecessary test in this context.

The plan includes the required UA and an acceptable CT, but the inclusion of the CBC adds an unnecessary test. Since the plan includes most of the essential tests but also includes some unnecessary tests, it aligns with the description for a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Patient is a 63 yoM who presents for flank pain of 1 day duration which is intermittent and severe in nature (9/10 on pain scale when spasm is present). He describes the pain as located on the right side and radiating to the groin; he says it doesn't radiate to the back as much. He has never had this before. He has noticed burning with urination. Position doesn't seem to affect his pain. He has increased frequency of urination. He endorses n brought on by the spasms and twice he has vomitted clear emesis. He did try some new exercises at the gym 2 days ago. ROS: Denies URI symptoms Denies heart palpitations Denies SOB N/v as described above No changes in BM, urinary complaints as described above No muscle aches PMHx: Med cond: prior hx of gout Surg: no prior surgeries Meds: no meds currently (stopped taking a medication of gout 1 year ago) No allergies Lives with wife No ETOH, tobacco, or drugs Famhx of gallstones in patient's mother
Response: The HPI provided includes several key components but also has some deficiencies based on the rubric criteria.

1. **Duration of Pain**: The student correctly mentions that the flank pain has been present for 1 day.
2. **Nature of Pain**: The pain is described as intermittent and severe (9/10), which is good. However, the description of the pain as "radiating to the groin" is included, but the answer key specifies that it should be noted that it does not radiate to the back as much. This is somewhat relevant but not clearly articulated.
3. **Symptoms**: The student mentions "burning with urination" and increased frequency, which aligns with the dysuria and urgency mentioned in the answer key. However, it does not explicitly state "urgency" and does not mention the absence of hematuria, which is a pertinent negative.
4. **Nausea and Vomiting**: The student notes clear emesis and that he has vomited twice, which aligns with the answer key.
5. **Spasms/Colic**: The student mentions spasms but does not specify the frequency (every 1-2 hours) as indicated in the answer key. The connection between the spasms and the pain could be clearer.
6. **Irrelevant Information**: The mention of trying new exercises at the gym is somewhat irrelevant to the current complaint and could distract from the key information.

Overall, while the student has documented several key findings, there are omissions of pertinent negatives (hematuria) and some specifics (frequency of spasms) that are necessary for a complete assessment. The organization is mostly clear, but the inclusion of some irrelevant information impacts the conciseness.

Based on these observations, I would score this section as a 3.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: 99.7 F 85 bpm HR 16 RR 128/82 BP SpO2 is 99% Room Air General: man of stated age in some distress. normal weight HEENT: normocephalic, oropharynx without erythema, eyes PERRLA and EOMI No LAD of cercival or supraclavicular chains Cardiac: no murmurs x4. No peripheral edema. BL pedal pulses present Pulm: no wheezes or rhonchi auscultated BL anteriorly and 3x posteriorly GI: inspection without obvious injury. BS present. No pain to palpation superficial or deep except with right flack. CVA tenderness present. No hepatosplenomegaly. No murphy's sign. MSK: no paraspinal tenderness. No weakness Derm: no rashes Neuro: strength intact BL for UE x3 and LE x2. Gait intact. 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings based on the rubric:

1. **Key Physical Exam Findings**: The findings include normal vitals and positive costovertebral angle tenderness, as well as the documentation of no abdominal tenderness. However, the note contains extensive details that may obscure the key findings.
   
2. **Organization**: The exam findings are organized by systems (General, HEENT, Cardiac, Pulm, GI, MSK, Derm, Neuro), which indicates a good structure. However, the level of detail in each section is quite extensive, which could detract from clarity.

3. **Omitted Findings**: While there are many positive findings documented, some pertinent negatives are missing. For instance, while the note mentions no murmurs and no peripheral edema in the cardiac section, it does not explicitly state other common negative findings that could be relevant.

Given these points, the note has most key positive physical exam findings documented and is generally well organized, but it lacks some pertinent negatives and includes excessive detail that obscures key information.

Based on the rubric, this would fall into the category of scoring a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 63 yoM with history of gout for which he currently is not treated presenting today for new onset sharp R flank pain. 
Response: To evaluate the provided statement based on the rubric, let's identify the essential elements present in the summary:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "new onset," which can be interpreted as acute onset.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement explicitly mentions "R flank pain."
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of pain is not specified in the statement.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement does not mention any characteristics of the pain such as spasms or colic.
5. **Optional elements**: There are no mentions of optional elements such as non-bilious vomiting or right groin pain.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- The statement includes 2 essential elements (acute onset and right flank pain).
- It is missing the intensity of pain and the description of pain characteristics.
- Therefore, it is missing multiple essential elements.

Based on the rubric:
- Since the summary is missing multiple essential elements, it would score a 2.

1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1) Urolithiasis (Kidney Stone) 2) Pyelonephritis 4) Back Muscle Strain 
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes:

1) Urolithiasis (Kidney Stone)
2) Pyelonephritis
3) Back Muscle Strain

Evaluating this against the rubric:

- The first two diagnoses (Urolithiasis and Pyelonephritis) are directly aligned with the answer key and reflect appropriate prioritization based on the likely causes of the patient's symptoms, which suggests a strong interpretation of the findings.
- The inclusion of "Back Muscle Strain" is an optional diagnosis. While it may be relevant, it does not prioritize the most likely causes of the symptoms as effectively as the first two diagnoses do. However, it is not entirely inconsistent with the findings.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, with the prioritization being mostly correct but slightly flawed due to the inclusion of a less relevant optional diagnosis without prioritizing the most pertinent ones.

Thus, I would score this section as a 3.

- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1) Urolithiasis (Kidney Stone): classic features of sudden onset flank pain which is severe. He has a history of gout, which is a risk factor. CVA tenderness was present. These all support the diagnosis of kidney stone. 2) Pyelonephritis: His sex of male makes this less likely; however he did endorse flank pain and burning with urination. 4) Back Muscle Strain: History of new physical exercises in last two days. However, burning with urination and lack of paraspinal or other back msk findings makes this less likely. 
Response: The provided differential diagnosis analysis includes the following points:

1) **Urolithiasis (Kidney Stone)**: The student accurately identifies the classic features of flank pain, references the patient's history of gout as a risk factor, and notes the presence of costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness. These points are well-supported and correctly link the patient's symptoms to the diagnosis of kidney stones.

2) **Pyelonephritis**: The student acknowledges that the patient's male sex makes this diagnosis less likely, which is a reasonable consideration. However, they do mention flank pain and burning with urination as supporting features. While these points are relevant, the reasoning could be stronger by discussing additional classic symptoms or findings that would be expected in pyelonephritis.

3) **Back Muscle Strain**: The student notes the history of recent physical activity, which could support this diagnosis. However, they correctly point out the absence of burning with urination and other musculoskeletal findings, which weakens the support for this diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported, with clear connections made for the most likely diagnosis (kidney stone) and reasonable considerations for the other diagnoses. There are some minor weaknesses in the linking for pyelonephritis, but they do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the analysis.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as a 3: "Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care."

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: UA with Urine Culture Renal US / CT stone protocol CBC
Response: To evaluate the provided plan against the rubric, we need to assess the components of the diagnostic workup:

- **Required Tests:** The plan includes a UA, which is essential and required.
- **Acceptable Tests:** The plan includes a renal ultrasound and a CT stone protocol, both of which are acceptable.
- **Unacceptable Tests:** The plan does not include any unacceptable tests such as endoscopy.

Now, analyzing the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the plan:

1. The UA is included, meeting the requirement.
2. The renal ultrasound is acceptable.
3. The CT stone protocol is also acceptable.
4. The CBC, while not listed in the answer key, is generally considered a reasonable test in many contexts, but it does not fall under the required or acceptable categories specified in the rubric.

Overall, the plan includes all essential tests (UA) and acceptable tests (renal ultrasound and CT stone protocol), but the inclusion of the CBC may be seen as unnecessary since it wasn't specified in the rubric. However, the plan does not include any irrelevant tests or unacceptable tests.

Given this analysis, the plan is reasonable and mostly aligns with the rubric, but the presence of the CBC could be seen as a minor deviation.

I would score this as a 3: "Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests."

3) Most features are organized with information presented in appropriate sections.
2) Some features are disorganized with information in the incorrect place or repeated and/or occasional sections missing.
1) Most features are disorganized, with appropriate sections missing.. Here is the answer key for org: . Please evaluate the following org and provide a score: History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 63 yoM who presents for flank pain of 1 day duration which is intermittent and severe in nature (9/10 on pain scale when spasm is present). He describes the pain as located on the right side and radiating to the groin; he says it doesn't radiate to the back as much. He has never had this before. He has noticed burning with urination. Position doesn't seem to affect his pain. He has increased frequency of urination. He endorses n brought on by the spasms and twice he has vomitted clear emesis. He did try some new exercises at the gym 2 days ago. ROS: Denies URI symptoms Denies heart palpitations Denies SOB N/v as described above No changes in BM, urinary complaints as described above No muscle aches PMHx: Med cond: prior hx of gout Surg: no prior surgeries Meds: no meds currently (stopped taking a medication of gout 1 year ago) No allergies Lives with wife No ETOH, tobacco, or drugs Famhx of gallstones in patient's mother

Physical Examination:
99.7 F 85 bpm HR 16 RR 128/82 BP SpO2 is 99% Room Air General: man of stated age in some distress. normal weight HEENT: normocephalic, oropharynx without erythema, eyes PERRLA and EOMI No LAD of cercival or supraclavicular chains Cardiac: no murmurs x4. No peripheral edema. BL pedal pulses present Pulm: no wheezes or rhonchi auscultated BL anteriorly and 3x posteriorly GI: inspection without obvious injury. BS present. No pain to palpation superficial or deep except with right flack. CVA tenderness present. No hepatosplenomegaly. No murphy's sign. MSK: no paraspinal tenderness. No weakness Derm: no rashes Neuro: strength intact BL for UE x3 and LE x2. Gait intact. 

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a 63 yoM with history of gout for which he currently is not treated presenting today for new onset sharp R flank pain. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1) Urolithiasis (Kidney Stone) 2) Pyelonephritis 4) Back Muscle Strain 

Supporting Information:
1) Urolithiasis (Kidney Stone): classic features of sudden onset flank pain which is severe. He has a history of gout, which is a risk factor. CVA tenderness was present. These all support the diagnosis of kidney stone. 2) Pyelonephritis: His sex of male makes this less likely; however he did endorse flank pain and burning with urination. 4) Back Muscle Strain: History of new physical exercises in last two days. However, burning with urination and lack of paraspinal or other back msk findings makes this less likely. 

Plan:
UA with Urine Culture Renal US / CT stone protocol CBC


Response: The organization of the provided note is quite comprehensive and follows a structured format that includes all necessary sections: History of Present Illness (HPI), Review of Systems (ROS), Past Medical History (PMHx), Physical Examination (PE), Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. 

1. The HPI is clear and provides relevant details about the patient's current issue, pain characteristics, and associated symptoms.
2. The ROS is succinct and addresses pertinent negatives effectively.
3. The PMHx is organized and includes relevant medical history, medications, and family history.
4. The Physical Examination is detailed and organized by systems, making it easy to follow.
5. The Summary encapsulates the critical points of the patient's presentation.
6. The Differential Diagnosis is clearly numbered and includes relevant considerations.
7. The Supporting Information effectively backs up the differential diagnosis with rationale.
8. The Plan is straightforward and outlines the next steps in management.

Given that all features are organized and presented in appropriate sections, I would score this note as a 4.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nathanial Ryan, 50yo M with PMH of gout to R big toe presents for evaluation of severe right flank pain x24 hours. Patient states pain began acutely with accompanying nausea, vomiting, dysuria, increased urinary frequency, urgency as well as dysuria. He describes his pain as constant with waxing and waning, rating 9/10 at its worst with intermittent radiation to his RLQ and groin. He denies any fever or hematuria. No previous similar symptoms. He reports drinking multiple cups of coffee per day and minimal water. He has a history of gout but denies any recent flares and is not currently taking any daily medications. No other pertinent PMH. No surgical history. Family history includes cholecystectomy, DM, and HTN. No family history of renal calculi. Non smoker. Occasional alcohol use. No history of IVDU. All other systems reviewed and negative. 
Response: In evaluating the HPI provided, we need to identify the presence and organization of key information according to the rubric.

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does mention severe right flank pain, which is acute and has been present for 24 hours. This aligns with the key information.
2. **Description of pain**: The patient describes the pain as constant with waxing and waning, which deviates from the expected description of sharp or colicky pain every 1-2 hours. This is a significant omission.
3. **Severity of pain**: The patient rates the pain as 9/10, which is correct.
4. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient mentions nausea and vomiting, but does not specify that the vomiting is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious. This is a pertinent negative.
5. **Dysuria and urgency**: The patient does report dysuria and urgency, which is present in the key information.
6. **Hematuria**: The patient denies hematuria, which is correctly documented.

Overall, while the HPI contains some key elements, it is missing critical details regarding the nature of the pain (sharp vs. constant) and the specifics of the vomiting (nonbloody/nonbilious). The organization is generally good, but the omissions impact the completeness of the history.

Given these points, I would score this HPI as a 2, as many key historical findings are omitted, and the organization is somewhat disorganized due to the deviation in the pain description.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: 99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, 99% ORA Gen: Acute distress secondary to pain HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, neck supple, no LAD, no oropharyngeal erythema or exudates CV: RRR, no murmurs/rubs/gallops, no edema, DP/PT pulses intact Resp: CTAB Abd: Soft, non tender, non distended Back: + R CVA tenderness, - L CVA tenderness GU: Deferred MSK: Normal strength in upper and lower extremties Nuero: CN 2-12 intact 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to identify the key components that were outlined in the answer key.

1. **Normal vitals**: The vitals are documented (99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, 99% ORA), which is appropriate.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The findings indicate positive right CVA tenderness (+ R CVA tenderness) but do not mention left CVA tenderness as a positive finding, which is relevant.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The abdomen is noted as soft, non-tender, and non-distended, which aligns with the requirement of documenting no abdominal tenderness.

Now, assessing the overall organization and completeness:
- The physical exam findings are well-organized and cover multiple systems.
- However, while the right CVA tenderness is noted, the absence of the left CVA tenderness could be viewed as a missing pertinent negative.
- The documentation is concise and relevant, but the missing negative finding affects the completeness.

Based on the rubric:
- The note includes almost all key physical exam findings but is missing a pertinent negative.
- Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a score of 4 but does meet the criteria for a score of 3.

Final score: 3

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathanial Ryan, 50yo M with a PMH of gout presents today for evaluation of acute onset severe R flank pain with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and urinary complaints. 
Response: To evaluate Nathanial Ryan's summary statement based on the rubric provided, we need to identify the essential elements present in the statement compared to the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - Present (acute onset)
2. **Right flank pain** - Present (severe R flank pain)
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - Present (severe intensity)
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - Missing (the statement does not mention spasms, colic, or waves of pain)
5. **Optional elements** - Present (nausea and vomiting)

Now, let's analyze the scoring criteria:
- The summary statement has 4 essential elements present (3 mandatory and 1 optional), but it is missing 1 essential element (the description of the pain as spasms, colic, or waves).

According to the rubric:
- **Score of 4**: All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
- **Score of 3**: Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
- **Score of 2**: Missing multiple essential elements
- **Score of 1**: No summary statement included

Since Nathanial's statement is missing one essential element, the appropriate score is a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Renal Calculi 2. Complicated UTI 2. Pyelonephritis 
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes:

1. Renal Calculi (which corresponds to nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic)
2. Complicated UTI (which could relate to UTI/pyelonephritis but is not a direct match)
3. Pyelonephritis (which is correctly identified)

The first and third items are accurate and consistent with the findings. However, the inclusion of "Complicated UTI" is somewhat vague and does not directly match the expected differential diagnosis, which could lead to minor flaws in prioritization. Overall, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, but the second item introduces some ambiguity.

Considering these factors, I would assign a score of 3 for this differential diagnosis.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Renal Calculi - Patient's acute onset, colicky R flank pain with accompanying N/V & urinary complaints makes renal calculi most likely. History of gout as well as lack of water intake and increased coffee intake also makes renal calculi a likely diagnosis. However, patient lacks hematuria which often presents with renal calculi. 2. Complicated UTI - Patients urinary complaints with flank pain as well as mild fever makes complicated UTI a likely diagnosis as well. However, the urinary symptoms did not precede the flank pain which makes this diagnosis less likely. 2. Pyelonephritis - Given patients mild fever and severity of flank pain with CVA tenderness, patient could also have pyelonephritis. Pyelonephritis could be caused by either renal calculi or complicated UTI. Patient would require further workup to confirm. 
Response: The student's differential diagnosis includes three potential conditions: renal calculi, complicated UTI, and pyelonephritis. 

1. **Renal Calculi**: The student correctly identifies the acute onset, colicky right flank pain, nausea, and vomiting as supporting evidence for renal calculi. They also mention the patient's history of gout and lifestyle factors (lack of water intake and increased coffee intake) which are relevant. However, the student notes the absence of hematuria, which is indeed a common symptom of renal calculi, but they still maintain that it is the most likely diagnosis. This shows a good understanding of the condition, but the acknowledgment of the missing hematuria could have been more explicitly linked to a possible impact on the diagnosis's strength.

2. **Complicated UTI**: The student mentions urinary complaints and flank pain, which are relevant. They also note the mild fever, which adds weight to this diagnosis. However, they correctly point out that the urinary symptoms did not precede the flank pain, which diminishes the likelihood of this diagnosis. This shows critical thinking and an appropriate level of support, despite the minor flaw in the order of symptoms.

3. **Pyelonephritis**: The student discusses the mild fever and severity of flank pain, which are relevant to this diagnosis. They correctly identify the potential link to renal calculi or complicated UTI as causes of pyelonephritis. The suggestion that further workup is needed is appropriate.

Overall, the student has provided an excellent differential diagnosis that is well-supported and contains correct and complete links to the diagnoses. While there are minor weaknesses (like the lack of hematuria for renal calculi and the order of symptoms for UTI), they do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the differential diagnosis.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as a 3.

2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Further workup of this patient would include a CBC to check for WBC and possible infection, CMP to check for renal function as well as any electrolyte imbalances from vomiting. Would also recommended a renal ultrasound to assess for presence of stone as well as pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis. Would also recommend IVF, zofran, and MMPC for symptomatic treatment. Will likely require admission and antibiotics. 
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for the diagnostic workup, we can break down the components based on the rubric criteria.

1. **Essential Tests**: The answer includes a CBC and CMP, which are not listed in the required or acceptable tests. The only essential test mentioned in the answer key is a UA, which is missing from the student's plan. The renal ultrasound is acceptable, but the CBC and CMP do not align with the essential tests required.

2. **Unnecessary Tests**: The plan does not include any unnecessary tests based on the rubric, but it does not adhere to the required tests either.

3. **Overall Evaluation**: The plan is ineffective as it misses the essential UA test and includes tests that are not specified as required or acceptable. The presence of relevant tests (like the renal ultrasound) does not compensate for the absence of the UA. 

Given these considerations, the score for this plan is a 2, as it includes some relevant components but ultimately fails to meet the essential requirements and includes irrelevant tests.

Summary:
Nathanial Ryan, 50yo M with a PMH of gout presents today for evaluation of acute onset severe R flank pain with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and urinary complaints. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Renal Calculi 2. Complicated UTI 2. Pyelonephritis 

Supporting Information:
1. Renal Calculi - Patient's acute onset, colicky R flank pain with accompanying N/V & urinary complaints makes renal calculi most likely. History of gout as well as lack of water intake and increased coffee intake also makes renal calculi a likely diagnosis. However, patient lacks hematuria which often presents with renal calculi. 2.

Response: The organization of this post-interview note is quite strong. The information is presented in a clear and structured manner, with distinct sections for the History of Present Illness, Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section contains relevant details that are logically grouped together, making it easy to follow the patient's case.

- The History of Present Illness is comprehensive and includes pertinent details about the patient's symptoms and medical history.
- The Physical Examination section is well-organized, providing vital signs and findings in a systematic way.
- The Summary succinctly captures the key points of the case.
- The Differential Diagnosis is clearly listed, with supporting information that logically follows each diagnosis.
- The Plan is thorough and clearly outlines the next steps for the patient.

Overall, while the note is very well organized, there are minor issues such as the repeated numbering in the Differential Diagnosis section (two "2." entries), which could create slight confusion. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall organization.

Given the criteria, I would score this section as follows:

He is concerned that it is related to his gallbladder. He appreciates a new onset of painful urination but denies any blood or different appearance in the urine. Concerned because he had to take time off of work. Mentions that he worked hard on the rowing machine recently and does not usually exercise. ROS: no fever, cough, changes in bowel movements, no headaches, no new bulges on his abdomen Past medical history: none Medications: none Past family history: father had gallstones Past social: no smoking, limited alcohol
Response: In evaluating the provided history of present illness (HPI) for Nathan Ryan against the rubric, we can identify the following points:

1. **Duration of Symptoms**: The HPI states "24 hours," which is correct.
2. **Type of Pain**: The description of flank pain is mentioned, but it is described as "constant and dull," which does not match the expected "sharp" description. There is mention of "intermittent additional sharp spasmodic pain," which partially aligns with the rubric but doesn't fully meet the expected description.
3. **Pain Severity**: The severity of pain is not quantified (e.g., no scale like 9/10 is provided).
4. **Associated Symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are noted, and the vomiting is described as "clear or nonbloody/nonbilious," which is acceptable. However, the frequency of vomiting is given as "2 times in the last 24 hours," which is not explicitly stated in the rubric.
5. **Dysuria and Urgency**: The patient mentions a "new onset of painful urination" but does not explicitly state urgency. Hematuria is denied, which is appropriate.
6. **Overall Organization and Relevance**: The HPI is somewhat organized but includes some extraneous details (e.g., concerns about gallbladder, rowing machine activity) that could be considered irrelevant to the acute presentation.

Given these observations, the HPI contains some key information but lacks clarity and precision in pain description, severity, and organization. Therefore, it would likely fall into the category of "many key historical findings omitted" and "disorganized or poorly documented."

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vital signs: 99.7 T, 85 HR, 16 RR, 128/82 BP, 99% O2 PE: HENT: no rhinorrhea, moist mucous membranes Respiratory: clear Abdominal exam: bowel sounds + in all 4 quadrants, RUQ and RLQ pain with palpation, liver not palpable, + Right CVA tenderness, no abdominal masses present, - rovsing sign, - psoas sign The rest of the PE was unremarkable. MSK: no difficulties with movement, no weakness noted
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, let's analyze the key components:

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are presented and appear to be normal (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation).
2. **Positive Findings**: 
   - Positive costovertebral angle tenderness is documented.
   - RUQ and RLQ pain with palpation is noted.
   - Clear respiratory exam is documented.
   - Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants.
3. **Negative Findings**: 
   - No abdominal tenderness is explicitly mentioned, but the lack of tenderness in the abdominal exam is noted with "no abdominal masses present" and "no rhinorrhea."
   - Pertinent negatives are included with - rovsing sign and - psoas sign.
4. **Organization**: The information is presented in a structured format (e.g., HENT, Respiratory, Abdominal exam, MSK) and is mostly concise.

Based on the rubric:
- The note includes almost all key physical exam findings as required.
- It is well organized with minimal irrelevant information.

However, the absence of a clear statement about "no abdominal tenderness" could be seen as a missing pertinent negative, which slightly impacts the scoring.

Considering all these factors, the score would be a 3, as most key positive findings are documented and well organized, but it misses the explicit mention of "no abdominal tenderness."

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathan Ryan is a middle-aged male with sudden onset of right flank pain radiating to the groin, dysuria, and right CVA tenderness on PE.
Response: To evaluate this note based on the rubric provided, we need to check for the presence of essential elements from the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The phrase "sudden onset" indicates acute onset, so this element is present.
2. **Right flank pain**: The note mentions "right flank pain," so this element is present.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not specified in the note, so this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The note does not mention spasms, colic, or that the pain comes in waves, so this element is also missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The note mentions "dysuria" and "right CVA tenderness," but these are not listed as optional elements in the answer key, and "right groin pain" is implied but not explicitly stated.

Based on the evaluation:
- Essential elements present: 2 (acute onset, right flank pain)
- Missing essential elements: 2 (intensity, spasms/colic)

According to the rubric:
- Missing multiple essential elements.

Thus, the score for this section is 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. complicated UTI with pyelonephritis 3. Appendicitis
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to consider how well it aligns with the findings from the patient's interview.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: This is consistent with the symptoms typically associated with kidney stones, such as flank pain and hematuria, which aligns with the key answer.
   
2. **Complicated UTI with pyelonephritis**: This is also relevant as it can present with urinary symptoms and flank pain, and it is a logical follow-up to consider given the potential for kidney involvement. However, the term "complicated" may suggest a severity that was not indicated in the findings, which could be seen as a minor flaw.

3. **Appendicitis**: While this can cause abdominal pain, it is not directly consistent with the primary findings related to nephrolithiasis or UTI symptoms. This diagnosis does not align well with the patient's reported symptoms.

Considering these points:
- The first two diagnoses are pertinent and reflect correct interpretation of findings.
- The inclusion of appendicitis, however, does not fit well with the symptoms described and detracts from the overall prioritization.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, but the inclusion of appendicitis introduces a flaw in prioritization that could affect patient care.

Given this analysis, I would score this section as a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. localized to the right flank, + CVA tenderness, dysuria, spasmodic pain that radiates towards the groin, sudden onset 2. dysuria, + nausea/vomiting, + pain, + CVA tenderness, but the pain is spasmodic 3. Right sided pain, + nausea/vomiting, but - rovsing and psoas sign
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis based on the information provided and the answer key, we will look at the support for each diagnosis mentioned.

1. The first set of symptoms includes right flank pain, positive costovertebral angle tenderness (CVA tenderness), dysuria, spasmodic pain radiating towards the groin, and a sudden onset. This strongly supports a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis (kidney stone), as it aligns well with the key points from the answer key. The CVA tenderness and dysuria also support a possible UTI or pyelonephritis. The spasmodic pain could further suggest renal colic. This section presents a well-supported differential diagnosis with correct links to the findings.

2. The second set indicates dysuria, nausea/vomiting, pain, and CVA tenderness, but specifies that the pain is spasmodic. This again supports the differential diagnosis of both UTI/pyelonephritis and nephrolithiasis. However, it lacks mention of flank pain, which weakens the connection to nephrolithiasis. Still, the presence of dysuria and CVA tenderness supports the UTI/pyelonephritis diagnosis.

3. The third set mentions right-sided pain with nausea/vomiting but lacks positive findings for Rovsing's and Psoas signs, which are more relevant for an inguinal hernia or appendicitis rather than the conditions listed in the answer key. This section is less clear in supporting a differential diagnosis, as it does not adequately connect to the findings of nephrolithiasis or UTI.

Overall, the support for the differential diagnoses is fairly strong in the first two sections, but the third section lacks robust connections. The links to the diagnoses are mostly correct and complete, but the weaknesses in the third section bring the overall score down.

Given the rubric criteria, I would assign a score of 3 for this differential diagnosis support, as it is appropriately supported but has some missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care.

Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. urine microscopy 2. urine culture 3. blood culture 4. CT abdomen or ultrasound 5. ESR and CRP 6. CBC w/ diff 7. CMP
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we will compare it to the rubric and the answer key.

The required test is a UA (urinalysis), which is not mentioned in the provided plan. Instead, the plan includes urine microscopy and urine culture, which are related but not the same as a UA. 

The acceptable tests include CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, and renal ultrasound. The provided plan includes a CT abdomen or ultrasound, which is acceptable. However, it does not include a BMP, which is missing.

The plan also includes ESR and CRP, CBC w/ diff, and CMP, which are not listed as acceptable or required in the answer key. These tests may be unnecessary depending on the clinical context.

Based on the rubric:
- The plan misses the essential UA test and includes some unnecessary tests (ESR, CRP, CBC, CMP).
- Overall, the plan does not effectively meet the criteria for an effective and efficient diagnostic workup.

Given these points, the plan is ineffective, missing essential tests, and including irrelevant tests.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle aged man presenting for right sided flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and dysuria for 24 hours. He reports that flank pain radiates to his back and that he is having intermittent back spasms. He is tolerating solids and liquids. He has tried tylenol for pain without relief. He denies diarrhea, constipation, fevers, hematuria, hematemesis. He has not had prior episodes of similar symptoms and denies history of UTI. He reports very little water intake on regular basis. PMH: Gout-last episode 2 years ago Medications: none Allergies: none Hospitalization/surgery: none FH: Father-diabetes and HTN, Mother-Cholecystectomy, Siblings are healthy with no chronic medical conditions SH: Drinks alcohol once a month, no tobacco or drug use
Response: To evaluate the provided history of present illness (HPI) against the answer key, we need to identify whether the key elements are present and how well they are documented.

1. **Right flank pain**: Present.
2. **Duration (x24 hours or acute)**: Present (24 hours).
3. **Sharp**: Not explicitly stated, but he describes it as "radiates to his back" and "intermittent back spasms," which may imply sharpness.
4. **Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours**: "Intermittent back spasms" mentioned, but frequency is not specified (not every 1-2 hours).
5. **Severe or 9/10 pain**: Pain severity is not quantified; it is not stated as 9/10.
6. **Nausea and vomiting**: Present.
7. **Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious**: Vague on vomiting; "tolerating solids and liquids" does not specify the nature of the vomiting.
8. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: Present (dysuria mentioned).
9. **No hematuria**: Present (denies hematuria).

Overall, while many key points are addressed, there are several omissions and areas where the documentation lacks specificity (e.g., pain severity, clarity on vomiting). The history is somewhat organized, but the missing details and lack of clarity on some points affect the overall quality.

Based on the rubric:
- The presence of key information is there, but with significant omissions and lack of clarity.
- The organization is decent, but some key details are missing.

Therefore, I would rate this section as a 2.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: T-99.7, HR-85, RR-16, BP-128/82, O2-99% on RA Constitutional: Alert and orientated x3, no in apparent distress, noticeably in pain HEENT: Normal oropharynx, no lymphadenopathy, normal dentition Cardio: Normal S1, S2, normal rate and rhythm, no peripheral edema, normal dorsalis pedis pulse Resp: Lungs CTAB, trachea midline Abdominal: Positive Right CVA tenderness, no abdominal tenderness (no suprapubic tenderness), no rebound tenderness, negative murphys sign, positive bowel sounds Neuro: Pupillary reflex normal, normal extraocular movements, strength 5/5 in bilateral upper and lower extremities, normal gait Psych: Normal mood and behavior MSK: no spinal tenderness 
Response: In evaluating the physical exam findings provided, we can identify several aspects:

1. **Key Physical Exam Findings**: 
   - Normal vitals are documented, which aligns with the answer key.
   - There is a positive finding of costovertebral angle tenderness, which is present in the documentation as "Positive Right CVA tenderness."
   - The absence of abdominal tenderness is noted, which matches the answer key's requirement.

2. **Organization and Conciseness**: 
   - The findings are organized by systems (Constitutional, HEENT, Cardio, etc.), which enhances clarity.
   - There is a good balance of detail without excessive irrelevant information, as the findings are pertinent to the patient's condition.

3. **Missing Pertinent Negatives**: 
   - While the documentation is thorough, the rubric indicates that "missing pertinent negatives" could impact the score. However, the provided exam does include key negative findings, such as no abdominal tenderness and no lymphadenopathy.

Given this analysis, the documentation includes all key physical exam findings, is well organized, and presents relevant information concisely without excessive detail. It does not appear to miss any significant findings.

Based on the rubric, this performance aligns closely with the criteria for a score of 4, as almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise, and well organized.

3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle aged man presenting for right sided flank pain, vomiting, and dysuria for 24 hours. Has remained afebrile. 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided statement against the rubric and the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "for 24 hours," which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement mentions "right sided flank pain," which satisfies this criterion.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not specified in the statement, so this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement does not mention spasms, colic, or waves of pain, so this element is missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement includes "vomiting" and "afebrile," which are part of the optional criteria but do not contribute to the essential elements.

In summary, the statement includes 2 essential elements (acute onset and right flank pain) but is missing 2 essential elements (pain intensity and the description of pain). 

According to the rubric, since multiple essential elements are missing, the score would be a 2.

2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Kidney stone 2. Pyelonephritis
Response: The differential diagnoses provided are "Kidney stone" and "Pyelonephritis." 

1. The first diagnosis, "Kidney stone," aligns well with common symptoms associated with renal colic, such as severe pain in the flank or abdomen, hematuria, and possibly urinary changes. This diagnosis is consistent with the findings typically observed in a patient presenting with symptoms indicative of nephrolithiasis.

2. The second diagnosis, "Pyelonephritis," is also relevant, as it reflects a possible infection of the kidney that could present with similar symptoms, including flank pain, fever, and urinary symptoms. This diagnosis is appropriate given the context of the symptoms.

Both diagnoses are pertinent and prioritize conditions that are likely based on the findings. There are no major flaws in prioritization, and they are reflective of a correct interpretation of the findings.

Given this evaluation, the differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings and appropriately prioritized.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Kidney stone: This is the most likely diagnosis due to positive right CVA tenderness. Pain is acute and focal to that area. Patient does not drink a lot of water. Pain is constant and there is associated UTI symptoms. Most likely this is an obstructing stone. 2. Pyelonephritis: This is also a component that can be occurring due to flank pain and dysuria. However, patient is afebrile and VSS. Will be able to rule in/out with additional labs. 
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes two potential conditions: kidney stones and pyelonephritis. 

1. **Kidney Stone**: The student identifies kidney stones as the most likely diagnosis, which is reasonable given the acute right flank pain and associated UTI symptoms. However, they mention "positive right CVA tenderness," which is not explicitly stated in the answer key as a finding for nephrolithiasis. The student also states that the pain is "constant," while the answer key indicates it should be "intermittent or colic." The mention of the patient not drinking a lot of water is relevant to the risk factors for kidney stones but is not explicitly linked to the findings listed in the rubric. Overall, the links to the diagnosis of kidney stones are partially correct but not complete.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: The student correctly identifies that flank pain and dysuria can suggest pyelonephritis. They also mention the patient's afebrile status, which is relevant to ruling out this diagnosis. However, they do not mention costovertebral angle tenderness, which is a key finding for pyelonephritis according to the answer key. This omission weakens the support for this diagnosis.

Overall, while the student has made an attempt to link symptoms to diagnoses, there are several inaccuracies and missing components that affect the clarity and completeness of the differential diagnosis. The reasoning is somewhat weak due to the lack of accurate links and omissions.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. CT stone protocol 2. U/A and urine cultures 3. CBC 4. CMP 5. IVF and pain medication 6. Consult urology after CT and UA is done if needed based on those labs/imaging 
Response: To evaluate the plan for diagnostic workup provided, we need to analyze the components against the rubric and the answer key.

1. **CT stone protocol**: This is not listed as an essential or acceptable test in the answer key. While it may be relevant in some cases, it is not specifically required or acceptable based on the rubric.
   
2. **U/A and urine cultures**: This is required and aligns with the essential tests needed for the workup.

3. **CBC**: This test is not mentioned in the answer key as required or acceptable, making it an unnecessary test in this context.

4. **CMP**: Similar to CBC, this test is not included in the answer key, making it another unnecessary test.

5. **IVF and pain medication**: While managing symptoms is important, this does not fall under the diagnostic workup category.

6. **Consult urology after CT and UA is done if needed based on those labs/imaging**: This is a reasonable step but depends on the results of the tests, which is not part of the initial workup plan.

Overall, the plan includes one required test (U/A), but it also includes two unnecessary tests (CBC and CMP) and one test (CT stone protocol) that is not acceptable according to the rubric. The inclusion of unnecessary tests and the lack of a clear focus on essential tests indicates that the plan is ineffective.

Based on this evaluation, I would score the plan as follows:
- Essential tests are missed (CT stone protocol, CBC, CMP).
- Some irrelevant tests included (CBC, CMP).
- Overall, it does not align well with the rubric.

Thus, the score for this section would be a 2.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 61 yom presenting for acute (yesterday AM) onset of R flank pain with radiation to his back and groin. Pain is 2/10 all times and comes and goes to a more severe pulsating/grabbing pain to a 9/10. Tylenol has not helped the pain and he has never had anything like this. He confirms nausea and vomiting along with new onset urinary urgency. He denies hematuria or change in frequency. He does note 3 days ago he went to the gym for the first time in a while and has sore muscles in his back after using the Row Machine. The patient is worried about gallstones as his mother had them and she had right sided pain as well. Other ROS - denies weight loss, vision changes. Denies diarrhea or constipation, denies dizziness. Denies change in stool patterns or consistency, denies itching, denies skin changes, denies post prandial stomach pain PMH : previous dx of GOUT w/ medication therapy for "a couple months" then RX was d/c. FMH : mother - gallstones father - T2DM, HTN surgical hx - none Allergies - none Meds - none Social Hx - lives at home w wife as insurance company manager. Normal diet w/ no restrictions and believes he has good water intake 3-4 quarts/daily 
Response: The provided HPI contains several key components, but it also has some omissions and inaccuracies based on the rubric criteria.

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does mention right flank pain, but the onset is described as "yesterday AM," which is not consistent with the key information that states the pain has been present for "x24 hours" or "acute." This could lead to confusion regarding the duration.
  
2. **Pain characteristics**: The description of the pain is somewhat inconsistent. The patient states the pain is "2/10 all times" and goes up to "9/10" during the severe episodes, but the key information specifies "sharp" and "spasms or colic every 1-2 hours," which are not addressed in the HPI.

3. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient confirms nausea and vomiting, but the description lacks detail about the nature of the vomiting (e.g., clear, nonbloody/nonbilious).

4. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient mentions urinary urgency and denies hematuria, which is good. However, the key information does not mention any details about urinary symptoms other than urgency.

5. **Omissions and organization**: The HPI includes some irrelevant details, such as the mention of sore muscles from gym activity, which distracts from the key historical findings. Additionally, while family history is provided, it is not directly relevant to the acute symptoms being evaluated.

Overall, while the HPI captures some of the necessary information, it omits key details and contains inaccuracies that obscure the essential history. Therefore, I would score this HPI as a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vital Signs : Temp 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 O2 99% RA HEENT : PERRL, Atraumatic normocephalic, no lymph node enlargement CV - RRR, no m/r/g, no S3 no S4, normal S1, S2, strong peripheral pulses BL, no peripheral edema Resp - bilateral no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi, good air movement, good breath sounds BL LL + UL. MSK - strength 4/4 UE, LE bilaterally. *Negative straight leg raise test bilaterally* Negative tenderness upon palpation of spinous processes or paravertebral muscles. Right CVA Tenderness upon light palpation. Abdomen - normal bowel sounds, no tenderness in any quadrant upon light or deep palpation, Skin - no lesions or rashes Neuro - normal gait, normal pupillary ROM 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the answer key, we will assess the presence of key findings, organization, and any irrelevant information.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are documented and show a slight fever (Temp 99.7) but are otherwise normal. This would be considered a positive finding since the answer key specifies "normal vitals." However, the slight fever does not align perfectly with "normal" and could be viewed as a pertinent negative.

2. **Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The documentation states "Right CVA Tenderness upon light palpation," which is a positive finding. This aligns with the answer key, which indicates that this finding should be present.

3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note states "no tenderness in any quadrant upon light or deep palpation," which meets the requirement of documenting no abdominal tenderness.

4. **Organization**: The findings are organized by system (HEENT, CV, Resp, etc.), which aids in clarity. However, the presence of some irrelevant details (like the specific heart sounds and strength grading) may obscure key findings.

5. **Pertinent Negatives**: The note does include some pertinent negatives (e.g., no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi, no peripheral edema, negative straight leg raise test, no tenderness upon palpation of spinous processes or paravertebral muscles). However, the absence of certain negative findings, such as the absence of lymphadenopathy in the HEENT section, could be noted as missing.

Overall, the documentation contains almost all key physical exam findings, is organized, but includes some irrelevant details and misses a few pertinent negatives. Thus, it aligns closely with a score of 3, as it has most key findings documented, but lacks some pertinent negatives.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 61 yom presenting for acute onset severe right flank pain with radiation to the groin, increased urinary urgency, and Right CVA Tenderness. 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided statement based on the rubric and the answer key.

The essential elements from the answer key are:
1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2. Right flank pain
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional: Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile.

Now, let's analyze Mr. Ryan's statement:
- "Acute onset" is present.
- "Severe right flank pain" is present.
- The intensity is indicated as "severe," which meets the requirement.
- However, there is no mention of spasms, colic, or the pain coming in waves.
- The statement includes "radiation to the groin," which is an important detail but does not fulfill the requirement for spasms or colic.
- "Increased urinary urgency" and "Right CVA Tenderness" are additional details but do not match any of the essential elements.

Now, let's tally the findings:
1. Acute onset - Present
2. Right flank pain - Present
3. 10/10 intensity - Present (severe intensity)
4. Spasms/colic/waves - Missing
5. Optional elements - Not fully addressed, but "radiation to the groin" is mentioned.

Since the statement is missing one essential element (spasms/colic/waves) and includes more than 5 total elements (acute onset, right flank pain, severe intensity, radiation to the groin, increased urinary urgency, right CVA tenderness), it falls into the category of "Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements."

Based on the rubric, this would score a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1) Kidney Stone/Nephrolithiasis 2) Pyelonephritis 
Response: The provided differential diagnoses include "Kidney Stone/Nephrolithiasis" and "Pyelonephritis." 

1. The first diagnosis, "Kidney Stone/Nephrolithiasis," is highly relevant given the patient's symptoms, particularly if they are experiencing severe pain, which is often associated with this condition. This aligns well with common presentations of renal colic.

2. The second diagnosis, "Pyelonephritis," is also pertinent as it is a potential complication of a urinary tract infection that may present with similar symptoms, especially if there are signs of infection or systemic illness.

The prioritization of these diagnoses is appropriate as both conditions are serious and could be the cause of the patient's symptoms. There are no major flaws in the prioritization, and the differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings presented.

Therefore, I would score this differential diagnosis as a 4, as it reflects a correct interpretation of findings with pertinent and prioritized options.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis

- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1) Neprolithiasis - Pt has right CVA tenderness with radiating pattern to his groin. The pain waxes and wanes with a maximum of 9/10. He also notes increased urinary urgency. He has nausea and vomiting as well with the severity of the pain. He's had a prior hx of GOUT which increases possibility that a uric acid stone is at fault as patient is no longer on medication. He also denied straight leg raise pain or paravertebral pain further moving away from MSK back complaint. 2) Pyelonephritis - Patient has increased CVA tenderness on the right side and has a mildly elevated temperature at 99.7. It's possible he has an infection. 
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis, both of which are supported by relevant patient findings. 

1) For nephrolithiasis:
- Right flank pain is described as acute, sharp, intermittent, and severe (9/10), which aligns well with the typical presentation of kidney stones.
- The mention of nausea and vomiting supports this diagnosis.
- The patient's history of gout is relevant as it suggests a predisposition to uric acid stones, which is a strong link.
- The denial of straight leg raise pain or paravertebral pain helps rule out musculoskeletal issues, reinforcing the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis.

2) For pyelonephritis:
- The right CVA tenderness is a classic sign of kidney infection.
- The mildly elevated temperature (99.7) raises suspicion for infection, although the note lacks additional symptoms such as dysuria or urgency, which would strengthen the diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well supported with correct and complete links to the findings. The connections made to nephrolithiasis are particularly strong, while the support for pyelonephritis is appropriate but slightly less comprehensive due to missing elements.

Based on the rubric:
- The differential diagnosis is appropriately supported, but the links for pyelonephritis are not as complete as they could be, which does not negatively impact patient care.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1) CT scan w/o contrast, UA/UC, BMP for kidney function, CBC to obtain WBC. Zofran, oxy, and flomax for symptom management and if stone >5mm consider surgical intervention as discussed w/ patient. Kidney Stone analysis to be complete upon retrieval/passing to determine composition and explore preventative measures. 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided plan against the rubric criteria.

1. **Included Tests**: The plan includes a CT scan without contrast, UA/UC, BMP, and CBC. The UA is required, and the BMP is acceptable. The CBC is not listed as an essential or acceptable test in the answer key, which raises some concern. The CT scan is also acceptable but not necessary for all cases, depending on the clinical context.

2. **Essential Tests**: The UA is included, which is essential, and the BMP is included as an acceptable test. The plan does miss some essential tests that could be relevant for a patient with kidney stones, such as a renal ultrasound, which is listed as an acceptable test.

3. **Unnecessary Tests**: The CBC does not appear to be essential or acceptable, which indicates an unnecessary test is included. The plan does not include any of the unacceptable tests like endoscopy.

4. **Overall Efficiency**: The plan has a mix of necessary and unnecessary tests. It does not fully align with the rubric's expectations for an effective and efficient plan, as it includes some unnecessary testing (CBC) and misses out on some acceptable tests (like renal ultrasound).

Given this analysis, the plan is reasonable but includes some unnecessary tests and misses some essential tests. Therefore, it falls into the category of a "reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests."

Vital Signs : Temp 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 O2 99% RA HEENT : PERRL, Atraumatic normocephalic, no lymph node enlargement CV - RRR, no m/r/g, no S3 no S4, normal S1, S2, strong peripheral pulses BL, no peripheral edema Resp - bilateral no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi, good air movement, good breath sounds BL LL + UL. MSK - strength 4/4 UE, LE bilaterally. *Negative straight leg raise test bilaterally* Negative tenderness upon palpation of spinous processes or paravertebral muscles. Right CVA Tenderness upon light palpation. Abdomen - normal bowel sounds, no tenderness in any quadrant upon light or deep palpation, Skin - no lesions or rashes Neuro - normal gait, normal pupillary ROM 

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a 61 yom presenting for acute onset severe right flank pain with radiation to the groin, increased urinary urgency, and Right CVA Tenderness. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1) Kidney Stone/Nephrolithiasis 2) Pyelonephritis 

Supporting Information:
1) Neprolithiasis - Pt has right CVA tenderness with radiating pattern to his groin. The pain waxes and wanes with a maximum of 9/10. He also notes increased urinary urgency. He has nausea and vomiting as well with the severity of the pain. He's had a prior hx of GOUT which increases possibility that a uric acid stone is at fault as patient is no longer on medication. He also denied straight leg raise pain or paravertebral pain further moving away from MSK back complaint. 2) Pyelonephritis - Patient has increased CVA tenderness on the right side and has a mildly elevated temperature at 99.7. It's possible he has an infection. 

Plan:
1) CT scan w/o contrast, UA/UC, BMP for kidney function, CBC to obtain WBC. Zofran, oxy, and flomax for symptom management and if stone >5mm consider surgical intervention as discussed w/ patient. Kidney Stone analysis to be complete upon retrieval/passing to determine composition and explore preventative measures. 


Response: The organization of the provided note is generally well-structured, with distinct sections for the History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section contains relevant and appropriately categorized information. The HPI clearly outlines the patient's symptoms and relevant past medical history. The Physical Exam is detailed and logically organized, covering all necessary systems. The Summary effectively encapsulates the main issues, while the Differential Diagnosis is clearly stated and supported by relevant information.

However, there are minor issues with some information being slightly repetitive or overly detailed in certain areas, particularly within the Supporting Information section. While it is informative, the note could benefit from more concise wording in some instances.

Overall, the organization is strong, with only slight disorganization present. Therefore, I would score this section as follows:

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI - Nathaniel Ryan is a 61 yo M with a history of right-sided flank pain since yesterday. He reports that his pain is at baseline but waxes and wanes with increased episodes of "sharp" pain that is rated 9/10 at its worst. The pain is at his side and radiates to the posterior side of his lower back. Nothing in particular that brought the pain on and Tylenol has not helped in alleviating his symptoms. Mr. Ryan also reports some nausea and 2/3 episodes of vomiting with the pain. There is reported pain and difficulty with urination during this time as well. He also reports to have an increased "urge" to urinate, with no reported episodes of incontinence. He is unsure what could be causing his symptoms but inquires whether his mother's history of gallstones could have anything to do with his presentation. ROS - There have been no constitutional symptoms like changes in energy, chills/fever, or any reported changes in bowel movements. He denies diarrhea and constipation. There is no reported hematemesis. He reports no blood in his urine and no other major concerns. PMHx - History of Gout Meds- No regular medications Allergies - There are no known drug allergies Surgical/Hospitalizations - No history of recent surgeries or hospitalizations Social Hx - one drink a month, no tobacco or recreational drug use reported. Works as a manager for an insurance company Family Hx - Mother with gallstones and history of cholecystectomy, father with T2DM and HTN.
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI against the rubric criteria, I note the following:

1. **Key Information Present**: The HPI includes the patient's age, gender, and a clear description of the right flank pain, including its duration (since yesterday), quality (sharp), severity (9/10), and associated symptoms (nausea and vomiting). However, it lacks specific mention of the frequency of the spasms or colic, which is a notable omission.

2. **Conciseness and Organization**: The information is generally well organized, with a logical flow from the pain description to associated symptoms and relevant history. However, some details, such as the mention of Tylenol and inquiries about gallstones, could be seen as slightly tangential to the primary complaint.

3. **Missing Pertinent Negatives**: The HPI does indicate the absence of hematuria, which is a pertinent negative, but it does not explicitly mention whether the vomiting is bilious or not, which is also relevant in this context.

4. **Overall Assessment**: While the majority of the key historical findings are documented, the omission of specific details regarding the frequency of spasms, the nature of the vomiting, and the lack of explicit mention of hematuria leads to a conclusion that many key historical findings are omitted or somewhat disorganized.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 2.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals 99.7 Temperature, 85 HR, 128/82 BP, 99% SPO2, 16 RR General - Well appearing, AOx3 HEENT - Non-tender and non enlarged superficial/deep cervical and posterior cervical lymph nodes. Non-erythematous oropharynx. Good dental hygiene, no scleral icterus. Cardiovascular - No murmurs, rubs or gallops. Normal rate and rhythm. 2+ bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses. No pitting edema of lower extremity. Respiratory - Normal lung sounds heard bilaterally in anterior and posterior fields. No crackles or wheezes on exam. Gastrointestinal - Distended abdomen, non-tender to superficial and deep palpation for 6 locations. No rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds heard on auscultation in 4 quadrants. No obvious hepatosplenomegaly. Negative Murphy's sign. SIGNIFICANT TENDERNESS TO PERCUSSION OF RIGHT FLANK. Neurological - Strong upper and lower strength bilaterally. Gait normal. EOM intact. Direct and indirect pupil response to light intact. 
Response: The provided physical exam findings include a comprehensive list of assessments across multiple systems, but there are some key aspects to consider based on the rubric.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vitals are documented, but the temperature is slightly elevated (99.7°F), which may not be considered "normal." Therefore, this aspect is partially met.

2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The note mentions "SIGNIFICANT TENDERNESS TO PERCUSSION OF RIGHT FLANK," which suggests positive costovertebral angle tenderness. This is documented correctly.

3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note states "non-tender to superficial and deep palpation for 6 locations" and "No rebound tenderness," which indicates no abdominal tenderness overall. However, the finding of a "distended abdomen" could be pertinent and should be noted as a possible concern.

Overall, the documentation is organized and covers many key physical exam findings. However, the inclusion of the distended abdomen without further context could be seen as a missing pertinent negative. The documentation is mostly well organized, but it does have some areas where clarity could be improved.

Based on these observations, I would rate this section as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 61 yo M with a PMHx of gout presenting with severe R flank tenderness and vomiting for 1 day.
Response: To evaluate Nathaniel Ryan's note based on the provided rubric and answer key, let's break down the essential elements that should be included:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The note mentions "for 1 day," which indicates acute onset.
2. **Right flank pain**: The note states "severe R flank tenderness," which corresponds to right flank pain.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The note mentions "severe" pain, which meets this criterion.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The note does not mention spasms, colic, or waves of pain, which is missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The note includes "vomiting," which is an optional element.

Now, let's evaluate the total elements included in the note:
- Present elements: Acute onset, right flank pain, severe intensity, and vomiting (4 total).
- Missing elements: The note is missing the description of spasms or colic (1 essential element missing).

According to the rubric:
- The note is missing 1 essential element (the description of spasms or colic) and contains 4 total elements, which is less than 5.

Thus, the score for this submission is a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: Nephrolithiasis is most likely at this time given his history of acute-onset pain of the right flank with significant tenderness to percussion of the area. His history of gout also is suggestive and puts him at higher risk for kidney stones. He has also had nausea and vomiting. It is less likely related to an infectious source but still possible given the location and onset of his pain and other urinary symptoms (dysuria/urge). 
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis as the primary concern, which aligns well with the patient's symptoms of acute-onset flank pain, tenderness, and associated nausea and vomiting. The mention of the patient's history of gout further supports this diagnosis, as it is a risk factor for kidney stones.

The note also acknowledges a potential infectious source, which is relevant given the urinary symptoms of dysuria and urgency. However, the prioritization seems to lean heavily towards nephrolithiasis without adequately addressing the possibility of a urinary tract infection (UTI) or pyelonephritis, which should be considered given the urinary symptoms.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is mostly consistent with the findings, but there are minor flaws in prioritization. The primary diagnosis is accurate, but the secondary options could have been more clearly articulated and prioritized.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: Nephrolithiasis - PMHx of gout - Acute-onset - Sharp intermittent pain of R flank (9/10) - Tenderness to percussion of area - Dysuria UTI - Dysuria, increased urge - Less likely with no constitutional symptoms
Response: To evaluate the provided support for the differential diagnosis, let's break down the key points against the criteria in the rubric.

1. **Nephrolithiasis (Kidney Stone/Renal Colic)**: 
   - The patient has acute-onset, sharp, intermittent pain in the right flank rated 9/10, which is consistent with nephrolithiasis.
   - The mention of PMHx of gout supports the possibility of nephrolithiasis as individuals with gout are at higher risk for developing kidney stones.
   - Tenderness to percussion of the area is also a relevant finding, supporting the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis.

2. **UTI/Pyelonephritis**: 
   - The patient reports dysuria and increased urge, which are classic symptoms of a UTI.
   - However, the note states "less likely with no constitutional symptoms," which suggests that while UTI is a consideration, it may not be the primary diagnosis given the absence of other symptoms like fever or malaise.

3. **Overall Assessment**: 
   - The differential diagnosis includes nephrolithiasis as the most likely diagnosis, well-supported by the acute flank pain and history of gout.
   - The support for UTI is acknowledged but is deemed less likely due to the lack of additional symptoms.
   - There is no mention of muscle strain or inguinal hernia, which could have been included for a more comprehensive differential diagnosis.

Based on these observations, the differential diagnosis is reasonably well-supported with correct links to the findings, but it lacks a complete exploration of other potential diagnoses. The connections made are appropriate, but there are some missing elements that prevent it from being fully comprehensive.

Therefore, I would assign a score of 3 for this section.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: U/A and CBC to rule out infectious source, hematuria, etc BMP to check renal function and electrolytes CT without contrast most sensitive and specific test for nephrolithiasis Less diagnostic but relevant- Good IV/PO hydration and pain management is important, with small stones symptoms may pass with time and could be more suggestive of stones.
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we can break down the components as follows:

- The plan includes a Urinalysis (UA), which is required and essential for evaluating the patient's symptoms.
- The inclusion of a Complete Blood Count (CBC) and a Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) is reasonable. The BMP is acceptable as it checks renal function and electrolytes, while the CBC could help rule out infection, although it is not explicitly listed in the answer key.
- The CT scan is included, but it is noted as "without contrast." While the CT scan is mentioned as the most sensitive and specific test for nephrolithiasis, the answer key does not explicitly list this as acceptable; it only states "CT abdomen/pelvis" without specifying contrast or non-contrast.
- The plan mentions hydration and pain management, which, while relevant, are not diagnostic tests.

Overall, the plan includes essential tests (UA and BMP) and has some reasonable components (CBC and CT), but it includes a CT without clear acceptance in the rubric. The plan does not contain unnecessary tests, but the ambiguity regarding the CT scan's acceptance could lead to a slight deduction.

Given these considerations, I would rate this plan as a 3: it is a reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, including most essential tests but also incorporating a potentially unnecessary or unclear test (the CT without contrast).

No obvious hepatosplenomegaly. Negative Murphy's sign. SIGNIFICANT TENDERNESS TO PERCUSSION OF RIGHT FLANK. Neurological - Strong upper and lower strength bilaterally. Gait normal. EOM intact. Direct and indirect pupil response to light intact. 

Summary:
Nathaniel Ryan is a 61 yo M with a PMHx of gout presenting with severe R flank tenderness and vomiting for 1 day.

Differential Diagnosis:
Nephrolithiasis is most likely at this time given his history of acute-onset pain of the right flank with significant tenderness to percussion of the area. His history of gout also is suggestive and puts him at higher risk for kidney stones. He has also had nausea and vomiting. It is less likely related to an infectious source but still possible given the location and onset of his pain and other urinary symptoms (dysuria/urge). 

Supporting Information:
Nephrolithiasis - PMHx of gout - Acute-onset - Sharp intermittent pain of R flank (9/10) - Tenderness to percussion of area - Dysuria UTI - Dysuria, increased urge - Less likely with no constitutional symptoms

Plan:
U/A and CBC to rule out infectious source, hematuria, etc BMP to check renal function and electrolytes CT without contrast most sensitive and specific test for nephrolithiasis Less diagnostic but relevant- Good IV/PO hydration and pain management is important, with small stones symptoms may pass with time and could be more suggestive of stones.


Response: The organization of the provided note is generally clear and follows a logical structure. The History of Present Illness (HPI), Review of Systems (ROS), Past Medical History (PMHx), Medications, Allergies, Surgical/Hospitalizations, Social History, and Family History are all appropriately categorized under the HPI section. The Physical Examination section is well-organized with vital signs listed first, followed by a systematic examination of different body systems. The Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan sections are also clearly delineated, making it easy to follow the thought process and clinical reasoning.

However, there are minor areas where the organization could be improved. For example, the HPI could be more succinctly summarized to avoid some repetition. Additionally, while the information is presented in appropriate sections, there might be slight overlaps in the details provided, particularly in the Differential Diagnosis and Supporting Information sections.

Overall, while there is room for improvement, the majority of the features are organized, and the information is presented in appropriate sections.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Patient is a middle aged male presenting for evaluation sharp, right sided flank pain that radiates into his back and began 24 hours ago. He describes the pain as colicky; the episodes occur every couple of hours and last for 2-20 minutes before subsiding. He has associated nausea and vomiting and has vomited 10+ times since the pain began. Reports urinary frequency and burning with urination. He has no history of similar episodes. He drinks a lot of coffee, little water, and went to the gym for first time in a year 3 days ago. History of acute gout flare up 1 year ago. 
Response: To evaluate the HPI based on the provided rubric, let's break down the key components:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does mention sharp, right-sided flank pain, which is present and correctly identified.
2. **Duration**: The patient states the pain began 24 hours ago, which is accurate.
3. **Character of pain**: The pain is described as colicky, which aligns with the expected description (spasms or colic).
4. **Severity**: The severity of the pain is not quantified (e.g., not rated on a scale of 1-10), which is a missing detail.
5. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are mentioned, but the vomiting is described as occurring 10+ times without specifying if it is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious, which is relevant.
6. **Dysuria and urgency**: Urinary frequency and burning with urination are documented, but the specific mention of dysuria is not clear, and there is no mention of hematuria.

Overall, the HPI contains many of the key components but is missing some details that are critical for a complete assessment, particularly the severity of the pain and specific characteristics of the vomiting. The organization is fairly clear, but the missing details detract from the completeness of the documentation.

Based on the rubric:
- The HPI has most of the key positive historical findings documented but misses some pertinent negatives (severity of pain, specific nature of vomiting).
- Thus, it does not meet the criteria for a score of 4, but it does include a substantial amount of relevant information.

Therefore, I would assign a score of 3.

2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Gen: appears well HENT: no LAD, PERRL, EOMI, no exudates in oropharynx Pulm: CTA bilaterally without wheezes rales or rhonchi. CV: RRR without murmurs rubs or gallops, no extremity swelling GI: No tenderness, normal bowel sounds, appears normal GU: Right sided CVA TTP, no left CVA TTP Skin: no rashes, warm, dry 
Response: The provided physical exam findings include several key components that align with the answer key. 

1. **Normal vitals** - This is implied but not explicitly stated; however, the rest of the findings suggest stable vitals.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness** - Documented as "Right sided CVA TTP" which indicates tenderness, thus this finding is present.
3. **No abdominal tenderness** - This is noted as "No tenderness, normal bowel sounds," which implies the absence of tenderness in the abdomen.

The organization of the exam is clear and follows a systematic approach (General, HENT, Pulmonary, Cardiovascular, Gastrointestinal, Genitourinary, and Skin). There are no irrelevant details, and the findings are concise and relevant.

The only potential missing element is the explicit mention of normal vital signs, but since the findings are otherwise comprehensive and organized, they meet the criteria for a higher score.

Considering the rubric:
- Almost all key physical exam findings are present.
- The documentation is concise and well organized.
- There are no irrelevant details, and the pertinent negatives are mostly included.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: Nephrolithiasis Pyelonephritis 
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. 

1. **Nephrolithiasis** (kidney stone) is a highly relevant diagnosis given the common presentation of renal colic symptoms, which would typically include severe flank pain, hematuria, and possibly nausea. This aligns well with the patient's symptoms.

2. **Pyelonephritis** (UTI with kidney involvement) is also a pertinent diagnosis, particularly if there are associated symptoms such as fever, chills, or urinary symptoms. It is a common complication of urinary tract infections and would be considered in a patient presenting with renal-related symptoms.

In this case, both diagnoses are pertinent and prioritized correctly based on the findings that would typically be associated with renal-related symptoms. There are no minor flaws in prioritization, as both conditions are relevant and appropriately ranked based on the likelihood of occurrence.

Therefore, the differential diagnosis reflects correct interpretation of findings and is well prioritized.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: Nephrolithiasis- Acute onset right sided colicky flank pain with CVA tenderness, dysuria, little water intake, history of gout Pyelonephritis/UTI- right flank pain with CVA TTP, less likely to be acute onset and colicky like this presentation, would likely have fever 
Response: The differential diagnosis presented includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis/UTI. 

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The student correctly identifies acute onset right-sided colicky flank pain, which aligns well with the key symptoms of nephrolithiasis. They mention costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness, which is relevant but should be more explicitly linked to nephrolithiasis rather than pyelonephritis. The mention of dysuria and little water intake is also pertinent, especially with the history of gout which supports the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis. Overall, the links to nephrolithiasis are mostly correct and complete.

2. **Pyelonephritis/UTI**: The student acknowledges that pyelonephritis is less likely in this case due to the absence of fever and the acute colicky nature of the pain. However, they do not provide sufficient evidence to support this diagnosis as strongly as nephrolithiasis. They also note CVA tenderness, which is relevant, but the reasoning could be clearer. The statement about the likelihood of fever is an appropriate consideration but lacks depth in the reasoning.

The differential diagnosis is appropriately supported for nephrolithiasis but has some missing links for pyelonephritis/UTI. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the differential diagnoses but lacks some clarity and completeness in linking findings to the diagnoses.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast - see if there is a stone UA - rule out UTI and pyelo, see if any abnormal findings are present CMP- assess electrolyte abnormalities that could be causing stones CBC- rule out bloodstream infection and assess WBC 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan against the rubric:

1. **CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast**: This is an acceptable test for assessing stones, so it aligns with the required tests.
2. **UA (urinalysis)**: This is a required test to rule out UTI and pyelonephritis, so it is appropriately included.
3. **CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel)**: This is acceptable for assessing electrolyte abnormalities that could be causing stones, thus it fits well within the plan.
4. **CBC (complete blood count)**: This is reasonable for ruling out a bloodstream infection and assessing WBC, which is relevant in this context.

Overall, the plan includes all essential tests (UA, CT abdomen/pelvis) and acceptable tests (CMP, CBC), with no unnecessary tests included. 

Thus, the plan is effective and efficient, meeting the criteria for a score of 4.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI - 24 hours of sharp, stabbing, intermittent right flank pain - acute onset of pain, no trauma immediately before - pain radiates to groin - spasms last 2 to 20 mins - 9/10 severity of pain when spasming - associated N/V, dysuria, and increased urinary frequency/urgency - denied fever, hematuria, discharge - he did go to the gym a few days ago and used the rowing machine which he thinks may be contributing to his pain - Tylenol and positional changes have not helped - pain is not associated with eating any food, even fatty food ROS 14 point review of systems performed and all negative except those listed in HPI PMHx - gout episode many years ago, no longer taking medication for it (did not know name of medication) Medications None Allergies None Surgical Hx None FMHx Mom (late 70s): gallstones Dad (late 70s): none SH Non-contributory- regular diet and exercise No tobacco, alcohol, other substances
Response: To evaluate the HPI provided against the rubric, we need to identify the presence and organization of key information as specified in the answer key.

1. **Right flank pain**: The student mentions "sharp, stabbing, intermittent right flank pain," which aligns with the key symptom.
2. **Duration**: The note states "24 hours," which matches the requirement for duration.
3. **Nature of Pain**: The description "acute onset of pain" is appropriate, but the answer key specifies "spasms OR colic every 1-2 hours," while the student describes "spasms last 2 to 20 mins." This does not fully meet the criteria.
4. **Severity**: The student correctly notes "9/10 severity of pain when spasming."
5. **Associated Symptoms**: The student includes "associated N/V, dysuria, and increased urinary frequency/urgency," which aligns with the answer key. However, the note on nausea and vomiting is not specific about being "clear or nonbloody/nonbilious."
6. **Negative Findings**: The student correctly documents "denied fever, hematuria, discharge," which aligns with the answer key.
7. **Additional Context**: The mention of the gym and rowing machine is not relevant to the key historical findings and could be considered extraneous information.
8. **Medications and PMHx**: The student notes a past medical history of gout and that the patient is not on any medications, which is fine, but does not provide specific details about the gout episode that could be relevant.
9. **Family and Social History**: This section is documented but does not contribute to the HPI directly.

Overall, while the HPI includes many key components, it misses some specific details (e.g., the nature of spasms, clarity of nausea/vomiting), has some disorganization, and includes irrelevant information about the gym. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for a higher score.

Based on these observations, I would assign the score as follows:

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: T: 99.7F HR: 85 RR: 16 BP: 128/82 O2: 99% on RA General: uncomfortable appearing man HEENT: MMM; normal oral mucosa without lesions or ulcers; no cervical LAD; EOMI; PERRLA CV: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops; no LE edema; normal distal pulses Pulm: CTAB Abdominal: severe CVA tenderness right flank; soft, flat abdomen; normoactive bowel sounds; non-tender to palpation in all quadrants, no suprapubic tenderness; negative Murphy's sign, negative psoas sign, no rebound tenderness, no hernias MSK: normal ROM, normal strength in b/l upper and lower extremities, no tenderness to palpation of right abdominal muscles Neuro: normal gait 
Response: In evaluating the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we can break it down as follows:

1. **Normal vitals**: The vital signs are documented as normal (T: 99.7F, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, O2: 99% on RA). This is a key finding and is included.

2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The note states "severe CVA tenderness right flank," which indicates a positive finding for CVA tenderness. This is included and clearly documented.

3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The documentation states "soft, flat abdomen; non-tender to palpation in all quadrants," which fulfills the requirement for documenting that there is no abdominal tenderness. Additionally, it mentions "no suprapubic tenderness," which reinforces the absence of tenderness.

The findings are organized well and provide a comprehensive overview without excessive irrelevant information. There are no key physical exam findings that are inaccurately documented or omitted. The only potential missing element is the mention of pertinent negatives; however, the note does include many pertinent negatives (e.g., no cervical LAD, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, etc.). 

Overall, while there is a slight lack of mention of some pertinent negatives in a few areas, the key findings are present, concise, and well-organized.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 4.

4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 55 year old man who presents with an acute onset of sharp, intermittent right flank pain that radiates to his groin and is associated with dysuria. 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided summary based on the rubric and the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: Present (acute onset mentioned).
2. **Right flank pain**: Present (right flank pain mentioned).
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: Not present (intensity is not specified).
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: Not present (intermittent pain is mentioned but does not specify spasms, colic, or waves).
5. **Optional elements**: Dysuria is mentioned but does not match the optional elements listed.

Now, let's count the essential elements:
- Present: 2 (acute onset, right flank pain)

2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Muscle Spasm
Response: In evaluating the differential diagnosis provided, the first two items are consistent with the findings related to urinary symptoms and potential kidney issues. Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is a common cause of renal colic and would be prioritized correctly based on the symptoms. Pyelonephritis (a kidney infection) is also a relevant consideration given the urinary tract involvement.

However, "Muscle Spasm" is less relevant in the context of the primary urinary symptoms presented by the patient, which may indicate a lack of prioritization in terms of the most likely causes of the symptoms. While muscle strain could be a consideration, it is not as pertinent as the first two diagnoses.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, but the inclusion of "Muscle Spasm" detracts from the prioritization, leading to a minor flaw that would not significantly impact patient care.

Based on this analysis, I would score this differential diagnosis as a 3.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis

- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis His presentation of acute onset, sharp, intermittent, flank pain that radiates to his groin with associated N/V, dysuria, and increased urinary frequency and urgency is highly indicative of a kidney stone. His exam was pertinent for right sided CVA tenderness which could also indicate a kidney stone. He also has a history of gout which places him at higher risk for uric acid kidney stones. Despite no prior history of stones, this is still the most likely diagnosis. The work up for this should include all items listed below. The CT can identify a stone and help plan for management if it is large than 5mm and needs surgical treatment. Additionally, the CMP can evaluate renal function to help gauge possible management options if the stone is large enough to be causing an obstruction and affecting kidney function. 2. Pyelonephritis His presentation of flank pain with associated N/V, dysuria, and increased urinary frequency and urgency could also be associated with pyelonephritis. Especially since he had significant right sided CVA tenderness, I would would want to rule out an infection. While he has not had a fever and his vital signs are stable, it is reasonable to check a CBC, UA, and urine culture to rule out an infection. 3. Muscle Spasm His presentation of right sided, spasming flank pain after going to the gym and using a new machine could also be due to a muscle spasm or MSK related pain. This is less likely given his associated N/V, dysuria, and the radiation of the pain. It is much more likely that his pain is due to the above two diagnoses, but it is reasonable to consider given his history.
Response: The differential diagnosis presented includes nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, and muscle spasm. 

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The student effectively links the patient's acute onset, sharp, intermittent flank pain with nausea and vomiting, as well as the history of gout, to kidney stones. They also mention relevant examination findings such as costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness, which supports the diagnosis. The consideration of necessary workup (CT, CMP) is appropriate and aligns with the diagnosis. Overall, this section is well-supported and complete.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: The student provides a reasonable differential for pyelonephritis, noting the flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and increased urinary frequency and urgency. They correctly identify the importance of ruling out infection given the CVA tenderness, even though the patient does not have fever or unstable vital signs. The mention of further testing (CBC, UA, urine culture) is appropriate but could be more strongly linked to the diagnosis. However, the overall reasoning is sound.

3. **Muscle Spasm**: The student acknowledges muscle spasm as a potential diagnosis, linking it to the recent gym activity and spasming pain. However, they also correctly note that this is less likely due to the associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and radiation of pain. While this diagnosis is weaker, it is still considered, which shows a comprehensive thought process.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well supported with correct links to the findings. The student has provided a thorough and logical assessment of the possible diagnoses, with appropriate reasoning for each.

1. **Essential Tests**: The required test (UA) is included, which is good. Additionally, the plan includes a CT Renal Stone Protocol of Abdomen and Pelvis, which is an acceptable test in this context. 

2. **Unnecessary Tests**: The CBC and CMP are not listed as essential or acceptable tests in the answer key. While they may provide useful information, they do not directly address the patient's symptoms based on the rubric provided. 

3. **Overall Assessment**: The presence of the UA and the acceptable CT scan indicates some reasonableness in the plan. However, the inclusion of the CBC and CMP, which are unnecessary in this context, detracts from its effectiveness.

Given that the plan includes essential tests but also unnecessary ones, it aligns most closely with a score of 3 on the rubric.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All features are organized, with information presented in appropriate sections.
3) Most features are organized with information presented in appropriate sections.
2) Some features are disorganized with information in the incorrect place or repeated and/or occasional sections missing.
1) Most features are disorganized, with appropriate sections missing.. Here is the answer key for org: . Please evaluate the following org and provide a score: History of Present Illness:
HPI - 24 hours of sharp, stabbing, intermittent right flank pain - acute onset of pain, no trauma immediately before - pain radiates to groin - spasms last 2 to 20 mins - 9/10 severity of pain when spasming - associated N/V, dysuria, and increased urinary frequency/urgency - denied fever, hematuria, discharge - he did go to the gym a few days ago and used the rowing machine which he thinks may be contributing to his pain - Tylenol and positional changes have not helped - pain is not associated with eating any food, even fatty food ROS 14 point review of systems performed and all negative except those listed in HPI PMHx - gout episode many years ago, no longer taking medication for it (did not know name of medication) Medications None Allergies None Surgical Hx None FMHx Mom (late 70s): gallstones Dad (late 70s): none SH Non-contributory- regular diet and exercise No tobacco, alcohol, other substances

Physical Examination:
T: 99.7F HR: 85 RR: 16 BP: 128/82 O2: 99% on RA General: uncomfortable appearing man HEENT: MMM; normal oral mucosa without lesions or ulcers; no cervical LAD; EOMI; PERRLA CV: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops; no LE edema; normal distal pulses Pulm: CTAB Abdominal: severe CVA tenderness right flank; soft, flat abdomen; normoactive bowel sounds; non-tender to palpation in all quadrants, no suprapubic tenderness; negative Murphy's sign, negative psoas sign, no rebound tenderness, no hernias MSK: normal ROM, normal strength in b/l upper and lower extremities, no tenderness to palpation of right abdominal muscles Neuro: normal gait 

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a 55 year old man who presents with an acute onset of sharp, intermittent right flank pain that radiates to his groin and is associated with dysuria. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Muscle Spasm

Supporting Information:
1. Nephrolithiasis His presentation of acute onset, sharp, intermittent, flank pain that radiates to his groin with associated N/V, dysuria, and increased urinary frequency and urgency is highly indicative of a kidney stone. His exam was pertinent for right sided CVA tenderness which could also indicate a kidney stone. He also has a history of gout which places him at higher risk for uric acid kidney stones. Despite no prior history of stones, this is still the most likely diagnosis. The work up for this should include all items listed below. The CT can identify a stone and help plan for management if it is large than 5mm and needs surgical treatment. Additionally, the CMP can evaluate renal function to help gauge possible management options if the stone is large enough to be causing an obstruction and affecting kidney function. 2. Pyelonephritis His presentation of flank pain with associated N/V, dysuria, and increased urinary frequency and urgency could also be associated with pyelonephritis. Especially since he had significant right sided CVA tenderness, I would would want to rule out an infection. While he has not had a fever and his vital signs are stable, it is reasonable to check a CBC, UA, and urine culture to rule out an infection. 3. Muscle Spasm His presentation of right sided, spasming flank pain after going to the gym and using a new machine could also be due to a muscle spasm or MSK related pain. This is less likely given his associated N/V, dysuria, and the radiation of the pain. It is much more likely that his pain is due to the above two diagnoses, but it is reasonable to consider given his history.

Plan:
1. CT Renal Stone Protocol of Abdomen and Pelvis 2. CBC 3. CMP 4. UA 5. Urine Culture


Response: The organization of the provided note is clear and follows a logical structure. Each section is appropriately labeled (HPI, ROS, PMHx, Medications, Allergies, Surgical Hx, FMHx, SH, Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan), which allows for easy navigation through the patient's information. There are no apparent repetitions or missing sections, and the information is presented in a coherent manner.

Based on the rubric:
- All features are organized, with information presented in appropriate sections.

The score for this section is 4.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 63 year old male with no prior medical history presenting for right sided pain starting one day ago suddenly when he was sitting on the couch. He says the pain radiates to the groin and comes and goes. he says the episodes will last 2-20 minutes and will be a 9/10 in severity. He has been having associated vomiting (2 episodes), nausea, decreased PO intake, dysuria and polyuria but denies SOA, chest pain, fever, hematuria, numbness, and diarrhea. He has never had an episode like this in the past. He reports he went to the gym for the first time a few days ago and did the row machine for 30 minutes so he thought he may have pulled something in his back. He took Tylenol which did not improve the pain. He does not smoke, drinks alcohol x2 a month, is not on any medications and has had no prior surgeries. Family history of gallstones in mom. 
Response: To evaluate the provided HPI (History of Present Illness) based on the rubric, we need to assess the presence and organization of key historical findings against the answer key.

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient reports right-sided pain, which is relevant, but it is noted as radiating to the groin, which may not align perfectly with "right flank pain" as described in the answer key.
2. **Duration**: The pain started one day ago, which matches the 24 hours or acute requirement.
3. **Character**: The pain is described as severe (9/10), but it is noted as coming and going rather than being sharp or colicky, which is a deviation from the answer key.
4. **Associated symptoms**: The patient has nausea and vomiting, but the vomiting is described as 2 episodes without specifying if it is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious. The presence of dysuria and polyuria is mentioned, but hematuria is specifically denied, which aligns with the answer key.
5. **Other pertinent negatives**: The patient denies shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, and diarrhea, which are relevant to the assessment but are not mentioned in the answer key.

Overall, the HPI captures some key elements but misses or misrepresents others, particularly the specific description of pain and the clarity of the vomiting. The history is somewhat organized but lacks some precision in key areas.

Given the evaluation:
- Almost all key information is present, but some details are inaccurate or omitted, particularly the character of the pain and the clarity of the vomiting.

The score is a 2, as many key historical findings are omitted or disorganized, obscuring what is key.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: VITALS HR: 85 BP: 128/82 T: 99.7 O2: 99% RA RR: 16 General: well appearing, no acute distress HEENT: normocephalic, atraumatic, no LAD, PERRL, EOMI Pulm: CTAB Cardio: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops, no peripheral edema, +2 DP pulses Abdomen: no abdominal tenderness, has right sided CVA tenderness, abdomen soft, no masses, normal bowel sounds MSK: right lower lumbar paraspinal tenderness, No C, T, L spine tenderness, 5/5 strength bilateral upper and lower extremities 
Response: The provided physical exam findings include several key components. 

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vitals are documented as normal, which is a positive finding.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: This is noted as right-sided CVA tenderness, which aligns with the key finding.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note indicates there is no abdominal tenderness, which is correctly documented.

The organization of the findings appears logical, with vital signs presented first, followed by a general assessment and then system-specific findings. There is no irrelevant information that obscures the key points, and the pertinent negatives (like the absence of abdominal tenderness) are included. 

Overall, the note captures almost all key physical exam findings, is concise, and is well organized.

Based on the rubric, this note fits the criteria for a score of 4.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 63 year old male with no prior medical history presenting for acute onset severe right flank pain with associated hematuria, polyuria, nausea and vomiting. 
Response: To evaluate Nathaniel Ryan's summary based on the rubric and answer key, we need to identify the essential elements present in his statement.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: Present (acute onset)
2. **Right flank pain**: Present (right flank pain)
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: Present (severe intensity)
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: Not present (no mention of spasms, colic, or waves)
5. **Optional elements**: 
   - Non-bilious vomiting: Present (nausea and vomiting)
   - Right groin pain: Not present
   - Afebrile: Not present

Now, let's summarize the findings:

- All essential elements are not present because there is one missing (spasms, colic, or waves).
- The statement includes more than 5 total elements (acute onset, right flank pain, severe intensity, hematuria, polyuria, nausea, and vomiting) which counts as 7 elements.

Based on the rubric:
- Missing 1 essential element (spasms/colic/waves) and the statement has more than 5 total elements.

Thus, the score is 3.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. kidney stone 2. lumbar strain 3. pyelonephritis
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to assess how well it aligns with the findings from the patient interview regarding their symptoms.

The answer key lists nephrolithiasis (kidney stone) and UTI/pyelonephritis as the primary differential diagnoses. The optional diagnoses of muscle strain and inguinal hernia are less relevant based on the information we have about the patient's symptoms.

1. Kidney stone: This is directly in line with the key and is a highly relevant diagnosis based on typical symptoms.
2. Lumbar strain: This is not listed in the answer key and while it could be a potential diagnosis, it is less relevant compared to the primary concerns.
3. Pyelonephritis: This is also in the answer key and is a relevant diagnosis based on the symptoms.

Overall, the differential diagnosis provided includes one correct and prioritized diagnosis (kidney stone), one relevant but less prioritized diagnosis (pyelonephritis), and one diagnosis that is not as pertinent (lumbar strain).

Given that the primary diagnosis (kidney stone) is included and correctly prioritized, but there is a minor flaw with the inclusion of lumbar strain, I would assess this as generally consistent with findings, but with minor flaws in prioritization.

Therefore, I would score this section as a 3.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Most likely a kidney stone due to associated urinary symptoms and the waxing and waning nature of the pain. Also has associated nausea and vomiting due to severe pain. 2. could have concomitant lumbar strain since had had right paraspinal tenderness but this is not what is causing his symptoms as his pain comes and goes randomly and is not triggered by anything. Also, the lumbar strain would have likely happened closer to his gym session however, it started a few days after he went to the gym 3. Pyelonephritis is not likely as he does not have a fever but still would need to rule it out
Response: The differential diagnosis presented shows a reasonable attempt to correlate the patient's symptoms with potential conditions. 

1. The mention of a kidney stone as the most likely diagnosis is well-supported by the associated urinary symptoms and the description of the pain as waxing and waning. The inclusion of nausea and vomiting as a result of severe pain further strengthens this link. 

2. The consideration of a lumbar strain is appropriate, but the explanation lacks clarity on how this might relate to the patient's primary symptoms. The reasoning that the pain is not triggered by anything and the timeline of the gym session is somewhat vague. 

3. The assessment of pyelonephritis is cautious, noting the absence of fever; however, it would be more complete if it included the need to assess for other urinary symptoms like dysuria or urgency, which are typically associated with this diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported, but there are some missing links and vague explanations that could impact patient care. Therefore, I would score this section as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: I would like to get a CBC and CMP to look at his white count and then see his renal function. Also, would like to get a CT abdomen and pelvis non contrast to look for a kidney stone. A CT would also allow us to look for signs of pyelonephritis. He needs a urinalysis to look for RBCs as well as evaluate for pyelonephritis by looking for signs of infection. He also needs fluids, zofran and opioid pain medication for his symptoms. 
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we can break down the components based on the rubric criteria:

1. The required test, urinalysis (UA), is included in the plan, which is essential for evaluating the patient's symptoms and potential kidney issues.
2. The plan includes a CT abdomen/pelvis, which is acceptable as it can help identify kidney stones and signs of pyelonephritis.
3. The plan also mentions a CBC and CMP, which are reasonable tests to assess white count and renal function, but they are not listed in the required or acceptable tests in the answer key. While they may provide useful information, they do not directly address the essential tests required for this scenario.
4. There are no unnecessary tests included in the plan, and the overall approach seems focused on the patient's symptoms.

Since the plan includes the required UA and an acceptable CT, but adds unnecessary tests (CBC and CMP), it falls into the category of a reasonable plan with some unnecessary tests.

Based on this analysis, I would score this plan as a 3.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 63yoM with no significant PMH who presented to the ED with concerns of R flank pain. Noticed the pain yesterday, describes it as "sharp spasms" occurring almost constantly on the R side of his back. Spasms occur every two hours and each episode last anywhere from 2 mins to 20 mins. No fever or abdominal pain. Tried OTC acetaminophen with no improvement. Pain is not positional. Also complaining of burning with urination and increased urinary frequency. Noted that 2 days ago, he was working out with the rowing machine, unsure if he pulled his back. FH - mom had cholecystitis No past surgical history PMH - podagra 2 years ago managed medically No outpt medications NKDA SH - lives with wife, does office work No Tob, EtoH or IVDU ROS as per HPI and positive for nausea and vomiting. Poor PO intake due to nausea.
Response: To evaluate the provided history of present illness (HPI) against the rubric, we need to assess the presence and organization of key information as outlined in the answer key.

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does report right flank pain, which is a key symptom. 
2. **Duration**: The pain is noted to have started "yesterday," which indicates it is acute (24 hours).
3. **Description of pain**: The patient describes the pain as "sharp spasms," which aligns with the requirement.
4. **Frequency of spasms**: The spasms occur every two hours, which is consistent with the answer key.
5. **Severity of pain**: The severity of the pain is not quantified (e.g., no 9/10 rating is provided).
6. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient reports nausea and vomiting, but does not specify if it is clear or non-bloody/non-bilious.
7. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient does report burning with urination and increased urinary frequency, which are relevant.
8. **Hematuria**: There is no mention of hematuria, which is a pertinent negative that should be included.

Overall, while the HPI contains much of the required information, it lacks specific details regarding the severity of pain and the nature of the nausea/vomiting. It also does not explicitly mention hematuria, which is a critical omission.

Given this evaluation:
- Key information is mostly present.
- The organization is somewhat coherent, but it lacks specific critical details.
- There are some pertinent negatives missing.

Thus, I would score this section as a 2, as it contains many key historical findings but is disorganized or poorly documented in some aspects.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: T 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 99% RA GEN: well appearing, not in acute distress HENT: no erythematous conjunctiva, no pharyngeal erythema, PERRLA CV: RRR, no murmurs, DP pulse 2+ RESP: CTAB, no adventitious sounds GI: NT, ND, BS+, R CVAT + MSK: normal gait, active ROM normal
Response: The provided physical exam findings include documentation of vital signs, a general assessment, and specific examinations of various systems, including head and neck, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems. 

1. **Normal vitals**: The vital signs are recorded as T 99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, which are all within normal limits.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: This is documented as CVAT +, indicating a positive finding.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: This is reflected in the GI section with "NT" (non-tender) and "ND" (non-distended).

The note is well organized, with relevant findings clearly documented. However, while the key positive findings are present, the note does not include some pertinent negatives that could be relevant to a complete physical exam (e.g., it does not explicitly state the absence of other significant findings in areas like the musculoskeletal or neurological systems).

Given the organization and the presence of key findings, but with the absence of some pertinent negatives, I would score this section a 3.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: 63yoM presenting to the ED with acute onset R flank pain with associated dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Afebrile and R CVAT + on exam. 
Response: To evaluate the provided response based on the rubric and the answer key, we need to identify the essential elements present in the statement.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - Present (acute onset)
2. **Right flank pain** - Present (R flank pain)
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - Not explicitly stated (intensity not mentioned)
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - Not explicitly stated (no mention of spasms or colic)
5. **Optional elements** - Present (afebrile noted)

Now, let's summarize the findings:

- The statement includes "acute onset" and "right flank pain," which are essential elements.
- It lacks mention of the pain intensity and the characteristic of the pain (spasms, colic, or waves), which are also essential elements.
- It includes one optional element (afebrile).

Based on the rubric:
- The response is missing multiple essential elements (specifically, intensity and description of the pain).
- Therefore, it would score a 2.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis - stone lodged in the R ureter causing spasmic pain 2. Pyelonephritis - ascending infection from UTI 3. Lumbago - MSK pain after overexerting 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, let's break down the findings in relation to the rubric:

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: This is correctly identified as a potential cause of the patient's symptoms (spasmic pain), and it matches the key finding of a kidney stone. This aligns well with the answer key.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: This is also correctly identified as a differential diagnosis and is consistent with the findings of an ascending infection from a UTI. This is a relevant and appropriate consideration based on the patient's symptoms.

3. **Lumbago**: While this represents a potential musculoskeletal cause of pain, it is somewhat less relevant compared to nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis given the context of the patient's symptoms. The term "lumbago" is broad and does not directly address the specific findings related to renal colic or infection.

Overall, the first two diagnoses are pertinent and prioritized correctly, while the inclusion of lumbago introduces some inconsistency as it may be seen as overly broad and not directly linked to the primary concerns of nephrolithiasis or pyelonephritis.

Given these considerations, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, but there are minor flaws in prioritization due to the inclusion of an optional and less relevant diagnosis (lumbago).

Therefore, the score for this differential diagnosis is 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Consistent with spasmic nature of the pain along with the localization to R flanks. r side nature of the symptoms encouraging for unilateral involvement. 2. Symptoms of dysuria, flank pain, and increased urinary frequency concerning for pyelo. Less likely due to lack of systemic findings like fever and hypotension. Pt is well appearing. Pt can have concomitant UTI. 3. does not explain the additional GU symptoms however can explain the sudden onset of back pain after working out with the rowing machine. Less likely in the differential due to other symptoms
Response: To evaluate the provided support for the differential diagnosis, we will analyze how well it connects the symptoms presented by the patient to the possible diagnoses listed in the answer key.

1. The first point discusses the "spasmic nature of the pain" and "localization to R flanks," which supports nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) well. The mention of "unilateral involvement" aligns with the right flank pain associated with both nephrolithiasis and UTI/pyelonephritis. This point is strong and clearly supports a differential diagnosis.

2. The second point presents symptoms of dysuria, flank pain, and increased urinary frequency, which are indeed concerning for pyelonephritis. However, it correctly notes that the absence of systemic findings like fever and hypotension makes this diagnosis less likely. The mention of the patient being well-appearing and the possibility of concomitant UTI provides a nuanced understanding of the situation. This point is appropriately supported.

3. The third point discusses muscle strain but notes that it "does not explain the additional GU symptoms." It does mention the sudden onset of back pain after working out, which weakly supports a muscle strain diagnosis. However, the lack of additional GU symptoms makes this diagnosis less likely in the context of the other symptoms presented.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well supported, with strong links to nephrolithiasis and UTI/pyelonephritis. The mention of muscle strain is noted but is less relevant given the context of other symptoms.

Based on the rubric:
- The support is strong and mostly complete, with appropriate links to the diagnoses, despite the third point being somewhat weaker.

Therefore, I would assign a score of 3 for this section.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. Kidney ultrasound to assess for ureteral dilatation and presence of stone. This will also allow for the quantification/sizing of the stone to assess if pt will require surgical management or we opt for conservative management. CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast if kidney U/S is nonconclusive. This will tell us if the stone is radiopaque or lucent to determine the type of stone involved. 2. U/A with reflex microscopy and urine culture to assess for UTI 3. conservative management, ice packs, tylenol, activity as tolerated. 
Response: The provided plan includes the following elements:

1. **Kidney ultrasound** - This is an acceptable test, as it assesses for ureteral dilatation and presence of stones.
2. **CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast** - This is also acceptable if the kidney ultrasound is inconclusive. It helps in determining the type of stone.
3. **U/A with reflex microscopy and urine culture** - This is required and addresses potential UTI.
4. **Conservative management** - This includes appropriate symptomatic treatment.

The plan is effective and efficient, including all essential tests (UA and acceptable imaging). There are no unnecessary tests included, and the rationale for each test is clear and relevant to the patient's symptoms.

Based on the rubric, this plan aligns with the criteria for a score of 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 50 y.o. male who presents for 24 h history of constant sharp 2/10 right flank pain with intermittent sharp "spasms" of pain that radiate to the groin and are 9/10 in intensity. He also endorses burning pain with urination since symptom onset. he says nothin makes his pain better or worse. He has associated nausea and vomiting during episodes of severe pain. He took "some Tylenol" earlier today with no relief. He went to the gym 3 days ago and is wondering if his pain could be related to this. ROS: positive for dysuria, no diarrhea, no abd pain, no diarrhea, positive for vomiting, no chest pain PMH: 1 episode of gout 3 years prior, not currently on any medications PSH: No prior surgeries Allergies: NKDA Meds: None FH: T2DM in mother, HTN in father SH: Works as a store manager, denies any history of drugs of alcohol
Response: The provided history of present illness (HPI) includes several key components, but there are some omissions and inaccuracies that affect the overall scoring:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient describes right flank pain as "constant sharp 2/10" instead of "acute" and does not specify the duration clearly as "x24 hours" since it’s stated as "24 h history." The pain intensity is noted as "9/10" during spasms, which is appropriate.
   
2. **Spasms or colic**: The patient mentions "intermittent sharp 'spasms'" of pain, which aligns with the rubric's requirement.

3. **Severity of pain**: The pain is described as "9/10" during severe episodes, which is consistent with the rubric.

4. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient endorses nausea and vomiting, but does not specify that it is "clear or nonbloody/nonbilious," which is a key detail missing from the documentation.

5. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient reports "burning pain with urination," which indicates dysuria, but there is no mention of urgency, and the documentation does not explicitly state "no hematuria."

Overall, while the HPI contains several elements, it misses some key details, such as the nature of the nausea and vomiting and the absence of hematuria. The organization is fairly clear, but the omissions affect the completeness.

Based on this analysis, I would score this section as a 2:

2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp 99.7 HR 85 BP 128/82 99% on RA ENT: normal dentition, mucous membranes moist Neck: no lymphadenopathy, neck supple CV: RRR no m/r/g, no edema in BLE, 2+ DP pulses Pulm: CTAB Abd: + ight sided CVA tenderness, abd soft, nontender to palpation, no hepatosplenomegaly, negative murphy's sign, negative rovsings sign Neuro: normal gait, PERRLA, EMOI, 5/5 strength in upper and lower extremities
Response: The provided physical exam findings include:

- Vitals: Normal with slight fever (Temp 99.7)
- Positive costovertebral angle tenderness (noted as "right sided CVA tenderness")
- No abdominal tenderness (noted as "abd soft, nontender to palpation")

In evaluating the documentation against the answer key:

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are reported, but the temperature indicates a slight fever, which deviates from the "normal" classification.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: This finding is documented and matches the key.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: This is documented correctly as "abd soft, nontender to palpation."

Overall, the key findings are mostly present, but the inclusion of a slightly elevated temperature may detract from the "normal" classification of vitals. The organization of the findings is clear and concise, with relevant details provided without excessive irrelevant information.

Given that almost all key physical exam findings are present and organized well, but with the caveat of the slightly abnormal vitals, I would score this section as a 3.

2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1) Nephrolithiasis 2) Pyelonephritis
Response: The provided differential diagnoses include nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis, both of which are relevant to the symptoms typically associated with urinary issues, particularly in the context of renal pain or infection. 

1) Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is a highly pertinent diagnosis given its common presentation and the likelihood of causing significant pain consistent with renal colic.
2) Pyelonephritis (a kidney infection) is also a strong consideration, especially if there are accompanying symptoms such as fever or dysuria, which would align with the findings from the patient interview.

The differential diagnosis presented is consistent with the findings and prioritizes the most likely causes of the patient's symptoms effectively. There are no major flaws in prioritization, as both diagnoses are relevant and appropriately sequenced based on their likelihood and severity.

Overall, this differential diagnosis reflects a correct interpretation of the findings.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1) Given intermit severe paroxysms of sharp pain, CVA tenderness, radiation to the groin, and associated dysuria, this presentation is most consistent with a kidney stone 2) Given his dysuria and CVA tenderness, this could represent pyelonehpritis, however his stable vital signs lack of fever, and nontoxic appearance make this less likely.
Response: The provided differential diagnosis support includes two main conditions: nephrolithiasis (kidney stone) and UTI/pyelonephritis, with some consideration of other conditions like muscle strain and inguinal hernia. 

1) The first part accurately identifies nephrolithiasis as the most consistent diagnosis based on the symptoms of severe paroxysms of sharp pain, CVA tenderness, and radiation to the groin. This is well supported by the information given in the answer key, linking the symptoms directly to the diagnosis of kidney stones.

2) The second part discusses pyelonephritis as a potential diagnosis but correctly notes that the patient's stable vital signs, lack of fever, and nontoxic appearance make this less likely. This reasoning is appropriate and shows an understanding of how to differentiate between the two conditions based on the clinical presentation.

However, the differential diagnosis does not mention muscle strain or inguinal hernia, which, while not the primary focus, could still be relevant given the patient's recent workout.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well supported, with correct links to the primary diagnoses and a logical reasoning process for ruling out other possibilities. There are no significant errors that would negatively impact patient care.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as a 3 for appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with minor omissions that do not detract from the overall quality.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CT Stone protocol UA micro, if positive leuks and nitrites will get culture 
Response: The provided plan includes a CT Stone protocol and a UA micro, which is acceptable based on the rubric. The UA micro is appropriate and aligns with the required tests. However, the inclusion of the CT Stone protocol could be considered unnecessary if the symptoms do not strongly indicate a stone-related issue. There is no mention of a BMP or renal ultrasound, which are acceptable tests that could have been included for a more comprehensive workup. 

Overall, the plan includes the essential UA test but lacks some of the other acceptable tests and includes a potentially unnecessary CT scan. Therefore, it can be classified as a reasonable plan that includes most essential tests but also some that may not be needed.

3) Most features are organized with information presented in appropriate sections.
2) Some features are disorganized with information in the incorrect place or repeated and/or occasional sections missing.
1) Most features are disorganized, with appropriate sections missing.. Here is the answer key for org: . Please evaluate the following org and provide a score: History of Present Illness:
Nathaniel Ryan is a 50 y.o. male who presents for 24 h history of constant sharp 2/10 right flank pain with intermittent sharp "spasms" of pain that radiate to the groin and are 9/10 in intensity. He also endorses burning pain with urination since symptom onset. he says nothin makes his pain better or worse. He has associated nausea and vomiting during episodes of severe pain. He took "some Tylenol" earlier today with no relief. He went to the gym 3 days ago and is wondering if his pain could be related to this. ROS: positive for dysuria, no diarrhea, no abd pain, no diarrhea, positive for vomiting, no chest pain PMH: 1 episode of gout 3 years prior, not currently on any medications PSH: No prior surgeries Allergies: NKDA Meds: None FH: T2DM in mother, HTN in father SH: Works as a store manager, denies any history of drugs of alcohol

Physical Examination:
Vitals: Temp 99.7 HR 85 BP 128/82 99% on RA ENT: normal dentition, mucous membranes moist Neck: no lymphadenopathy, neck supple CV: RRR no m/r/g, no edema in BLE, 2+ DP pulses Pulm: CTAB Abd: + ight sided CVA tenderness, abd soft, nontender to palpation, no hepatosplenomegaly, negative murphy's sign, negative rovsings sign Neuro: normal gait, PERRLA, EMOI, 5/5 strength in upper and lower extremities

Summary:
Nathaniel Ryan is a 50 y.o. male who presents with 24 hr history of acute right flank pain, with dysuria and right CVA tenderness. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1) Nephrolithiasis 2) Pyelonephritis

Supporting Information:
1) Given intermit severe paroxysms of sharp pain, CVA tenderness, radiation to the groin, and associated dysuria, this presentation is most consistent with a kidney stone 2) Given his dysuria and CVA tenderness, this could represent pyelonehpritis, however his stable vital signs lack of fever, and nontoxic appearance make this less likely.

Plan:
CT Stone protocol UA micro, if positive leuks and nitrites will get culture 


Response: The organization of the provided note is mostly clear and follows a logical structure, with distinct sections for the History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section contains relevant information pertaining to the patient's condition and is presented in a way that is easy to follow. 

However, there are minor issues that detract from the overall organization:
- The Review of Systems (ROS) section includes a repetition of "no diarrhea," which could lead to confusion.
- The Physical Examination section could benefit from clearer headings for each system examined (e.g., "ENT," "Neck," "CV," etc.) to enhance clarity.

Despite these minor issues, the note is largely organized and presents the information in appropriate sections. Therefore, I would rate this section as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: CC: right sided pain HPI: Mr. Ryan is a 62 yo male presenting for a one day history of worsening flank pain. He descibes the pain as sharp, colicky , and spasm like in nature. He endorses that the pain radiates to his right groin. Denies any aggravating or relieving factors. Has tried tylenol, which did not improve pain. Other associated symptoms include increased urinary urgency, mild burning with urination, however denies hematuria. He also denies any fatigue, unintentional weight loss, N/V. Otherwise, patient voices that he is in significant pain throughout the interaction, and asked about pain medications. I noted that I would mention this to my attending to discuss when he sees the patient. ROS: Negative except as listed in HPI PMH: -History of gout, presenting as podagra. Was treated two years ago and has not had return of symptoms. PSH: None Meds: -Tylenol PRN for flank pain Allergies: None Family History: -Mom has history of gallstones Social history: -Does not smoke -Drinks beer 1-2 x per week..
Response: The HPI provided includes several key components related to the patient's symptoms. 

1. **Chief Complaint**: The patient presents with right-sided pain, which is relevant.
2. **Duration**: The history indicates a one-day duration, which is acceptable but does not specify that it is acute or that it has been present for 24 hours.
3. **Pain Description**: The pain is described as sharp and colicky, which aligns with the answer key.
4. **Pain Severity**: The severity of the pain is not provided as a numerical scale (e.g., 9/10), which is a missing component.
5. **Associated Symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are not mentioned, but urinary urgency and mild burning with urination are included. However, nausea and vomiting were specifically noted in the answer key as important associated symptoms.
6. **Denial of Pertinent Negatives**: The patient denies hematuria, which is correctly documented.

Overall, while the HPI includes some key information, it omits the severity of pain, the nausea and vomiting component, and does not explicitly state the acute nature of the pain. Therefore, many key historical findings are either missing or not clearly documented, which affects the overall organization and completeness.

Based on the rubric provided, I would score this HPI as a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: On assessment, Mr. Ryan is a 62 yo male with hx of gout who presents with one day of worsening right colicky flank pain and CVA tenderness on exam. 
Response: To evaluate the provided statement against the rubric, we will look for the essential elements outlined in the answer key:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - The statement indicates "one day of worsening," which suggests acute onset.
2. **Right flank pain** - The statement mentions "right colicky flank pain."
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - The intensity of the pain is not explicitly stated as 10/10 or severe. This is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - The statement includes "colicky" which satisfies this criterion.
5. **Optional elements** - There are no optional elements mentioned such as non-bilious vomiting or right groin pain.

Based on this analysis, the statement has:
- All essential elements except for the intensity of the pain (missing 1 essential element).
- The total number of elements included is 4.

According to the rubric:
- Since there is one missing essential element, the score would be a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. Both conditions are relevant to the symptoms typically associated with renal issues, such as flank pain or urinary symptoms. 

1. Nephrolithiasis (kidney stone) is a primary consideration given the common presentation of renal colic.
2. Pyelonephritis is also a relevant diagnosis, particularly if there are accompanying symptoms of infection, such as fever or dysuria.

The provided differential diagnosis is pertinent and prioritized correctly, as it focuses on the most likely causes of the symptoms presented by the patient. However, it does not include other potential diagnoses such as UTI, which could be relevant depending on the full presentation of symptoms.

Given that the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings and prioritizes the most likely conditions, but lacks some comprehensiveness by not including all relevant options, I would assess it as having minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis- most likely diagnosis given colicky, right flank pain, inability to get comfortable during physical exam, as well as history of gout, which increases his likelihood of uric acid stones. The spasm like pain, urinary urgency, and slight burning on urination also support this diagnosis. 2. Pyelonephritis- Less likely, however must be considered given his CVA tenderness. He denies any history of UTIs, which typically precedes pyelonephritis. Additionally, on physical exam, would expect patient to appear more lethargic, more toxic appearing. 
Response: The differential diagnosis presented has a strong foundation, particularly for nephrolithiasis, which is well supported by the symptoms of colicky right flank pain, the patient's history of gout, and the description of urinary urgency and burning. The rationale for nephrolithiasis is clear and directly ties the patient's symptoms to the diagnosis.

However, the consideration of pyelonephritis is somewhat weak. While the mention of costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness is appropriate, the reasoning provided lacks a strong connection to the patient's findings. The statement about the patient denying a history of UTIs is relevant but does not directly link to the acute presentation of pyelonephritis. Additionally, the note about the expected appearance of the patient during a physical exam could be more clearly articulated in relation to the differential.

Overall, the differential diagnosis has a solid primary diagnosis with adequate supporting details, but the secondary diagnosis lacks some necessary links to the patient's findings. Therefore, this submission falls into the category of "appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care."

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. Perform full GU exam with chaperone. 2. UA and Urine culture 3. CT w/o contrast of abd and pelvis 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, let's break it down according to the rubric and the answer key.

1. The plan includes performing a full GU exam with a chaperone, which is relevant but not a diagnostic test. Therefore, it does not directly contribute to the diagnostic workup.
2. The plan includes a UA and urine culture, which are essential tests and required according to the answer key.
3. The plan also includes a CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast. While this is an acceptable test, it is not listed as required, and the rubric does not specify the necessity of this test in relation to essential tests.

Overall, the plan includes the essential UA and urine culture but also includes a CT abdomen/pelvis, which may not be necessary depending on the differential diagnoses. Since the plan has one essential test and one acceptable test, and no unnecessary tests are included, it falls into the category of a reasonable plan that includes most essential tests but also includes some unnecessary tests.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 3.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI: Mr. Ryan is a 60 year old male that presents with right flank pain that began a few days ago. The pain comes and goes and it can be from 2 min to 20 mins. He rates the pain a 9 out of 10. The pain will shoot down towards the groin area. He states the pain is like a "stinging sensation". However, between the shooting pain, he states its a 2/10. The majority of the pain in on his right side in the flank region. This is the first time he has had such pain. He also complains of dysuria (burning when peeing) and peeing more than usual. He has become nauseas from this and has vomited 2 times, but it was clear vomit. He did try taking tylenol for the pain, but it did not help. He has no constipation or diarrhea. No trouble with bowel movements. No recent illnesses. No fevers that he knows of. PMH: had gout on his toe 2 years ago that was treated with medication that he cannot remember, but has not been on any medication for it since then. No other medical concerns Past surgical history: none Social History: drinks 1-2 glasses of wine a week, no smoking. States he eats a healthy diet. Medications: none Allergies: none Family History: mother has history of gallbladder problems A complete 12 point ROS was done and it was negative except for nausea, vomiting, dysuria, peeing more than regular, and right flank pain. 
Response: The HPI provided includes several key elements, but there are also notable omissions and disorganization present. 

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does report right flank pain, but the onset is stated as "a few days ago," which does not align with the requirement for "x24 hours or acute." 
2. **Pain characteristics**: The description of the pain includes a rating of 9/10, which is accurate. However, the pain is described as "stinging" and "shooting down towards the groin," which diverges from the expected descriptors of "sharp" or "colic/spasms." The mention of the pain being a 2/10 at times is also not relevant to the key information required.
3. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient does report nausea and vomiting, noting that the vomit was clear, which aligns with the requirements.
4. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient mentions dysuria but describes it as "burning when peeing" rather than simply stating dysuria or urgency. However, urgency is not explicitly mentioned.
5. **Hematuria**: The patient does not mention hematuria, which is appropriate as it aligns with the requirement of "No hematuria."

Overall, while the HPI contains some relevant information, it misses key points such as the exact duration of pain (which should be acute), the specific descriptors for pain, and the urgency aspect of dysuria. The organization is somewhat disjointed, making it harder to extract the pertinent details.

Based on the rubric, I would score this HPI as a 2, as it has many key historical findings omitted and is disorganized.

To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals temp: 99.7 degrees HR: 85 RR: 16 BP: 120/82 O2 99% on room air General: In some acute distress, but well appearing HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA, normal appearing conjunctiva, moist mucous membranes, no lymphadenopathy present Neck: no masses present, no lymphadenopathy present, supple with full movement Cardio: RRR, no rubs/gallops/murmurs, non cyanotic, no edema present Respiratory: clear to auscultation bilaterally, equal chest rise Abdomen: pain on palpation of right flank, but no pain on left flank, regular abdominal sounds present, non tender abdomen, non distended abdomen, non rigid abdomen, no hepatosplenomegaly MSK: 5/5 strength in upper and lower extremities, no rashes present Neuro: regular gait, alert and oriented Psych: appropriate mood
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to identify the presence and organization of key findings, as well as any missing pertinent negatives.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are documented and include a slight fever (99.7 degrees), heart rate (85), respiratory rate (16), blood pressure (120/82), and oxygen saturation (99% on room air). While the vital signs are mostly normal, the slight fever could be considered an abnormal finding. However, the presence of normal blood pressure and oxygen levels is noted.

2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The note states "pain on palpation of right flank," which indicates positive costovertebral angle tenderness. However, it is not explicitly labeled as such, which may lead to some confusion.

3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The findings include "non tender abdomen," which aligns with the rubric. However, it also states "pain on palpation of right flank," which contradicts the absence of abdominal tenderness.

4. **Organization**: The findings are organized by system, which is a positive aspect. However, the presence of conflicting information regarding abdominal tenderness may confuse the reader.

5. **Omitted Key Findings**: While many key findings are included, there is no mention of pertinent negatives in the abdominal exam (e.g., no rebound tenderness, no guarding) which could be considered important for a thorough assessment.

Overall, while the majority of key physical exam findings are present and organized, the conflicting information regarding abdominal tenderness and the lack of some pertinent negatives detracts from the overall quality of the documentation.

Given this analysis, I would assign a score of 2 for this section.

3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 60 year old male that presents with right flank pain that began a few days ago with dysuria and positive pain on palpation of right kidney.
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements present and determine if any are missing.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions that the pain began "a few days ago," which does not satisfy the acute onset or past 24 hours criteria.
2. **Right flank pain**: This element is present.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not mentioned; therefore, this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: This element is also missing as there is no mention of spasms or colicky pain.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement includes "dysuria," which is not in the optional elements listed (non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, afebrile). 

Based on the evaluation:
- The statement is missing multiple essential elements (acute onset, pain intensity, and pain characteristics).
- Therefore, it falls under the category of "Missing multiple essential elements."

The final score is 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Kidney Stone 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Acute Appendicitis 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to compare it against the answer key and the rubric.

The student has listed:
1. Kidney Stone
2. Pyelonephritis
3. Acute Appendicitis

Now let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Kidney Stone** - This is correct and matches the answer key (nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic).
2. **Pyelonephritis** - This is also correct and consistent with the answer key (UTI/pyelonephritis).
3. **Acute Appendicitis** - This is not mentioned in the answer key and does not directly relate to the symptoms typically associated with kidney stones or urinary tract infections.

Now, assessing the overall consistency with the findings:
- The first two diagnoses (kidney stone and pyelonephritis) are pertinent and prioritized correctly based on the symptoms likely presented by the patient. 
- However, the inclusion of acute appendicitis introduces an incorrect differential that is not supported by the findings related to the primary conditions being considered (kidney stone and UTI).

Based on the rubric:
- The differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings (the first two diagnoses), but the inclusion of acute appendicitis introduces a minor flaw in prioritization that could potentially impact patient care if not recognized as less likely.

Thus, the score for this differential diagnosis would be a 3, as it is generally consistent with findings but has a minor flaw in prioritization.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Kidney stone -pain on palpation -dysuria -no fever -makes you nauseas -history of gout -radiates to groin 2. Pyelonephritis - dysuria -would cause fever - no history of UTI recently -less likely than kidney stone 3. Acute Appendicitis - right lower region pain -however he does not have a fever - he still has an appendix - will make you nauseous and vomit due to pain - however, would be getting significantly worse these past days -it would not radiate to the groin
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to analyze how well each diagnosis is supported by the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.

1. **Kidney Stone**: 
   - The note mentions right flank pain, which is acute and sharp, consistent with renal colic. 
   - Nausea is present, and there is a history of gout, which can predispose to nephrolithiasis.
   - However, the mention of "pain on palpation" and "dysuria" could be misleading since dysuria is not a typical symptom of kidney stones unless there is concurrent infection.
   - Overall, this diagnosis is well-supported but has a slight issue with the inclusion of dysuria and pain on palpation.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: 
   - The note correctly identifies right flank pain and mentions dysuria, which is appropriate. 
   - The reasoning that it would cause fever is also correct, and the absence of a recent UTI makes this diagnosis less likely.
   - However, the conclusion that it is "less likely than kidney stone" is appropriate given the symptoms, but the differential lacks some key elements such as costovertebral angle tenderness.

3. **Acute Appendicitis**: 
   - The note mentions right lower quadrant pain, which is not consistent with the patient's reported symptoms of right flank pain.
   - The reasoning about fever and the worsening of symptoms over days is accurate, but it does not align well with the current presentation.
   - The note also correctly states that pain would not radiate to the groin, which is a good point.

Overall, the differential diagnosis presented demonstrates an understanding of the conditions but has some inaccuracies and misalignments with the patient’s symptoms. The links to the diagnoses are present but not entirely accurate or complete.

Given these considerations, I would rate the differential diagnosis as follows:
- Kidney stone: good support but minor inaccuracies
- Pyelonephritis: reasonable but some missing links
- Acute appendicitis: not well-supported as it does not correlate with the symptoms

This results in a differential diagnosis that is appropriately supported but with some inaccuracies that would not significantly impact patient care. Therefore, the score is:

3

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. UA 2. CT with no contrast 3. CBC to look at white count 4. CMP to look at electrolytes and creatine level 
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup:

1. **UA (Urinalysis)** - This is a required test and is included.
2. **CT with no contrast** - This is an acceptable test.
3. **CBC (Complete Blood Count)** - This is not listed in the answer key as an essential or acceptable test, which means it falls into the category of unnecessary tests.
4. **CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel)** - This is also not listed in the answer key, and while it may provide some useful information, it is not specified as an acceptable test.

The plan includes the required UA and an acceptable CT, but it also includes two tests (CBC and CMP) that are not specified in the answer key. Therefore, the plan has essential tests included but also includes unnecessary tests. This aligns with a score of 3, as it represents a reasonable plan for the diagnostic workup that includes most essential tests but also includes some unnecessary tests.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI Nathaniel Ryan is a middle-aged male presenting to the ER with right flank pain. Patient reports concerns over right flank pain that began yesterday morning. The pain radiates to his right mid-back. The pain has also radiated to his right inguinal crease a couple of times, last time being last night. Reports some burning when he urinated this morning despite drinking plenty of water. The right flank pain is constantly present (2/10), punctuated by "bad spells" where it is much worse (9/10). Walking does not exacerbate the pain. Flank pain not relieved with acetaminophen. Patient has not noticed any red or brown discoloration of his urine. He has experienced some urinary urinary urgency since yesterday evening. Mentions he has had some N/V in association with his "bad spells" of right flank pain. Denies any fevers, chills, diarrhea, constipation, or abnormal bulges. ROS See HPI for pertinent positives and negatives. PMHx Gout, treated for two months; not currently taking a prophylactic agent No past injuries, hospitalizations, or surgeries. No known drug allergies. FHx Mother had gallstones, followed by a cholecystectomy Father has DM and HTN SHx No smoking. Drinks one small glass of wine per month, no use of drugs not prescribed to him
Response: The HPI provided contains several key elements, but it is missing some critical information as outlined in the answer key. 

1. **Right Flank Pain**: The patient does mention right flank pain, but it is described as "constantly present (2/10)" rather than acute (x24 hours). The description of the pain is somewhat vague, as it also includes references to radiating pain and does not specify if it is sharp or colicky. The mention of "bad spells" is a positive aspect, but it does not align with the requirement of spasms or colic every 1-2 hours.

2. **Nausea and Vomiting**: The patient reports nausea and vomiting, but it is not specified whether the vomiting is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious. This is a pertinent negative that is missing.

3. **Dysuria and/or Urgency**: The patient reports burning during urination and urinary urgency, which aligns with the requirement. However, the absence of hematuria is noted, which is good.

Overall, while the HPI contains some relevant information, it does not fully meet the requirements specified in the answer key. Key elements are missing or inadequately described, particularly regarding the pain characteristics and the details about nausea and vomiting.

Based on the rubric:
- The note is not well organized and is missing several key historical findings.
- The history is somewhat disorganized, obscuring what is key.

Given these considerations, I would score this HPI as a 2.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vital signs: T 99.7 F, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, O2 sat 99% on RA General: Appears stated age, no acute distress HEENT: No posterior oropharyngeal erythema, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally, EOM intact bilaterally, no anterior or posterior cervical lymphadenopathy Cardiovascular: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Respiratory: CTA bilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes GI: Symmetric abdomen, no abnormal bruising, normoactive bowel sounds, no abdominal tenderness throughout, negative Murphy's sign, negative Psoas sign, positive for CVA tenderness on right side (negative on left) Neurologic: 5/5 strength throughout, no gait abnormalities Psychiatric: Appropriate mood and affect for presentation
Response: In evaluating the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we can analyze the following:

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are reported and appear normal, which is consistent with the answer key.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The physical exam notes that there is positive CVA tenderness on the right side, which aligns with the key finding.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note states "no abdominal tenderness throughout," which adheres to the key finding.

The documentation is organized well, covering all the necessary systems: general, HEENT, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurologic, and psychiatric. The findings are concise and relevant, with no excessive irrelevant details.

However, while the key positive findings are present, the note does not explicitly mention any pertinent negatives for the other systems, which could be considered a minor shortcoming.

Overall, the physical exam findings are comprehensive, well organized, and mostly align with the rubric requirements, but the absence of some pertinent negatives in the documentation affects the score.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a middle-aged male presenting to the ER with acute, unrelenting right-sided flank pain with radiation to the right mid-back and right inguinal crease at times associated with right CVA tenderness on examination.
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric, let's identify the essential elements based on the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement indicates "acute" but does not specify the time frame as "past 24 hours." However, "acute" implies a recent onset.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement mentions "right-sided flank pain," which satisfies this requirement.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not specified in the summary; therefore, this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement describes "unrelenting" pain but does not indicate spasms, colic, or waves of pain, so this element is also missing.
5. Optional elements: The statement does mention right CVA tenderness, but it does not include non-bilious vomiting or afebrile status.

Now let's summarize the findings:
- Acute onset is implied.
- Right flank pain is present.
- Intensity is not specified.
- Spasms or wave-like pain is not mentioned.
- Optional elements are not included.

Based on the rubric:
- The summary includes 2 essential elements (acute onset and right flank pain).
- It is missing 2 essential elements (intensity and spasms/waves).
- The total number of elements mentioned is 4, which is less than 5.

According to the rubric:
- This would fall under "2) Missing multiple essential elements."

Final score: 2

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis/ureterolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes "Nephrolithiasis/ureterolithiasis" and "Pyelonephritis." 

1. The first diagnosis, nephrolithiasis/ureterolithiasis, is appropriate given the context of the symptoms typically associated with kidney stones, such as severe pain and possibly hematuria. This aligns well with the findings.

2. The second diagnosis, pyelonephritis, is also relevant as it is a possible complication of a urinary tract infection that can present with similar symptoms, particularly if there is fever, flank pain, or urinary symptoms.

Both diagnoses are pertinent and prioritized correctly based on common presentations of renal-related symptoms. There are no significant flaws in the prioritization, and the differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings.

Therefore, I would score this differential diagnosis as a 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis/ureterolithiasis: Patient reports constant acute right-sided flank pain with radiation to the right mid- back and sometimes the right inguinal crease. Associated with nausea/vomiting when the pain becomes episodically severe. Patient has a history of gout, which could suggest uric acid stones, but calcium oxalate stones are still highest on my differential because they are just more common. Most notably, patient has positive right CVA tenderness and is afebrile. 2. Pyelonephritis: Patient is experiencing acute onset, constant but episodically severe, right-sided flank pain with radiation to the right mid-back. Patient's flank pain is associated with N/V when severe. Patient has right-sided CVA tenderness on examination. However, this diagnosis is lower on the differential than kidney/ureteral stones because the patient is lacking systemic symptoms (e.g., T 99.7 F in ER, no chills).
Response: The differential diagnosis presented includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis, with appropriate reasoning provided for both. 

1. For nephrolithiasis, the student correctly identifies the right-sided flank pain as acute and constant, with radiation to the mid-back and inguinal area. They mention the associated nausea and vomiting, which aligns with renal colic. The history of gout is relevant and supports the possibility of uric acid stones, which is well articulated. However, the mention of CVA tenderness is more commonly associated with pyelonephritis, which might slightly weaken the link to nephrolithiasis, but the student does note that the patient is afebrile, which is consistent with this diagnosis.

2. For pyelonephritis, the student notes the right-sided flank pain, its acute onset, and the associated nausea and vomiting. They correctly point out the positive CVA tenderness, which supports this diagnosis. However, they also mention the absence of systemic symptoms, which is a valid argument for placing this diagnosis lower on the differential.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well-supported with relevant patient findings and reasoning. There are some minor inaccuracies, such as the interpretation of CVA tenderness, but they do not significantly impact patient care. The student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the differential diagnoses and their connections to the patient's symptoms.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. CT PE (stone protocol) to look for kidney stones 2. Labs, including CBC (to see WBC count), CMP (to look at BUN and creatinine), urinalysis (to look for microscopic hematuria) 3. Antiemetic (Zofran) for nausea relief 4. Toradol for pain relief
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we need to consider the components listed in the answer key.

1. **CT PE (stone protocol)**: This is an acceptable imaging study for evaluating kidney stones. However, it is not listed as a required test in the answer key. It is relevant but not essential.
   
2. **Labs, including CBC, CMP, and urinalysis**: 
   - CBC: This is acceptable as it helps assess WBC count, which can indicate infection.
   - CMP: This is acceptable as it includes BUN and creatinine, which are relevant to kidney function.
   - Urinalysis: This is required and looks for microscopic hematuria, which is relevant to the symptoms.

3. **Antiemetic (Zofran)**: This is a treatment for nausea and not part of the diagnostic workup, so it does not contribute to the score regarding the effectiveness of the diagnostic plan.

4. **Toradol for pain relief**: Similar to Zofran, this is a treatment and not part of the diagnostic workup.

Overall, the plan includes the essential urinalysis and relevant labs but also includes a CT scan that, while acceptable, is not the most efficient choice given the context. It does not include any unnecessary tests, but it could be argued that the CT scan is somewhat excessive if the urinalysis and labs are sufficient for the initial evaluation.

Based on the rubric:
- The plan includes most essential tests (urinalysis, CMP, CBC) but adds a CT scan which is not required and may be considered unnecessary given the information provided. 

Thus, I would score this plan as a 3, as it is a reasonable plan that includes most essential tests but also includes some unnecessary tests.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: CC: right flank pain HPI: Nathaniel Ryan is a 49 year old previously healthy male who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute onset right flank pain. Patient states the pain began 24 hours previously. He describes it as sharp and waxing and waning. He states every few hours he will have an episode of excruciating pain (4 out of 5) that will last for a few minutes. He notes the pain radiates to his groin during some episodes. He has not noted any specific triggers such as eating, movement, or positions. He has had 1 episode of non-bloody, non-bilious vomit. He has tried Tylenol without improvement in his pain. He describes urinary urgency and an "increased pressure" when he voids, but not dysuria. He has had a bowel movement within the last day. He does have a history of gout, but notes that this pain is different than those flare ups. PMH: gout Meds: None Allergies: None Surgical history: tonsillectomy Social History: Lives at home with wife. Eats a healthy diet for his gout, but notes he does drink mostly tea, not water. FMH: Mom had a cholecystectomy for cholecystitis. ROS: Negative for fevers, headaches, diarrhea, chest pain, or SOB. 
Response: In evaluating the provided history of present illness (HPI), the following key points from the rubric must be considered:

1. **Key Information Present**: The HPI includes right flank pain, the duration (24 hours), the character of the pain (sharp), and the severity (described as 4 out of 5, which is not a 9/10 as per the answer key). However, it mentions episodes of excruciating pain, which may not align with the expected severe pain descriptor. 

2. **Spasms or Colic**: The description of "waxing and waning" pain does not explicitly mention spasms or colic, which is a significant omission.

3. **Nausea and Vomiting**: The patient reports one episode of non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting, which aligns with the answer key.

4. **Dysuria and Urgency**: The patient describes urinary urgency and increased pressure but does not report dysuria, which is documented correctly.

5. **Hematuria**: There is no mention of hematuria, which is consistent with the answer key.

Overall, while the HPI contains some key elements, it lacks complete and accurate descriptions of the pain severity and the specific nature of the pain (spasms or colic). Additionally, the organization is fairly clear, but the absence of certain key points affects the overall completeness.

Given these considerations, the score for this HPI based on the rubric would be a 2, as many key historical findings are omitted, and the history is somewhat disorganized in terms of key descriptors.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: T: 99.7, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, O2: 99% on RA General: Sitting up in chair, no acute distress. HEENT: No cervical lymphadenopathy. Normal dentition. Tonsils absent. Cardio: RRR, no M/R/G appreciated. No lower extremity edema. 2+ posterior tibial pulses. Respiratory: bilateral breath sounds with no wheezes, stridor, rhonchi, or crackles Abdomen: Bowel sounds heard. No tenderness to palpation of abdomen. No guarding. Right CVA tenderness. MSK: No skin lesions, or abnormal bruising noted. Neuro: PERRLA. EOM intact. Normal gait. 5/5 strength for bilateral biceps, triceps, upper extremity abduction, hip flexion, knee flexion, knee extension. No obvious deficits. Psych: appropriate mood and affect. 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to identify the presence of key findings as outlined in the answer key.

1. **Normal vitals**: The vital signs provided (T: 99.7, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, O2: 99% on RA) are normal and documented.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The report mentions "Right CVA tenderness," which indicates this finding is present.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The note states "No tenderness to palpation of abdomen," which indicates this negative finding is documented.

Now, let's assess the overall organization and completeness of the physical exam findings:

- The vital signs and general assessment are clearly documented.
- The findings are organized by system (HEENT, Cardio, Respiratory, Abdomen, MSK, Neuro, Psych), which contributes to clarity.
- All key physical exam findings from the answer key are present: normal vitals, positive CVA tenderness, and absence of abdominal tenderness.
- There is no irrelevant information that obscures the key findings.

Since all key findings are present, concise, and well organized, I would score this section as a 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 49 year old male who presents with (1) acute onset right flank pain that is (2) sharp, (3) radiating to his groin, (4) associated with urinary urgency and has (5) right CVA tenderness on exam.
Response: In evaluating the provided note against the rubric, we can identify the following:

1. The note mentions "acute onset," which corresponds to the first essential element.
2. "Right flank pain" is also mentioned, fulfilling the second essential element.
3. The intensity of pain is described as "sharp," but it does not meet the criteria of "10/10 intensity OR severe intensity," which is a missing element.
4. There is no mention of spasms, colic, or that the pain comes in waves, which is another missing element.
5. The note does not include any optional elements such as non-bilious vomiting or afebrile status.

The note has two missing essential elements (intensity and the nature of pain) and includes a total of five elements. Therefore, this note does not meet the criteria for a higher score.

Based on the rubric, this results in a score of 2, as it is missing multiple essential elements.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: Ddx: 1. Urolithiasis 2. Nephrolithiasis 3. Pyelonephritis
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes:

1. Urolithiasis
2. Nephrolithiasis
3. Pyelonephritis

Evaluating this against the answer key:

1. **Nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic** is included in the student's answer as both "Urolithiasis" and "Nephrolithiasis" refer to kidney stones, so this is consistent with the findings.
2. **UTI/pyelonephritis** is represented by "Pyelonephritis," which aligns with the answer key.
3. The optional diagnoses of muscle strain and inguinal hernia are not present in the student's differential diagnosis, but they are not required for a passing score.

The differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings, as it includes the relevant conditions associated with the symptoms presented. However, the inclusion of both "Urolithiasis" and "Nephrolithiasis" could be seen as redundant since they refer to the same condition. This might indicate a minor flaw in prioritization, but it does not significantly impact patient care.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, with minor flaws in prioritization.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1 and 2. Urolithiasis and Nephrolithiasis: Patient presents with an acute onset waxing and waning, sharp, right flank pain with associated CVA tenderness and radiation to groin. With his history of gout, he is at increased risk of uro- and nephrolithiasis. His presentation is classic for a stone. As he is having waxing and waning symptoms, it could be within the ureters, and is increasing in pain with peristalsis of ureters. Similarly it could be within his kidneys. 3. Pyelonephritis: While patient does have CVA tenderness on exam and is expressing some urinary urgency, he is afebrile and does not note dysuria. Likely the urinary urgency comes from a stone and not pyelonephritis. 
Response: The differential diagnosis presented includes urolithiasis/nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis, which are both relevant given the patient's symptoms of acute right flank pain, CVA tenderness, and a history of gout. The explanation effectively links the symptoms to the potential diagnoses, particularly for nephrolithiasis, where the sharp, intermittent pain and waxing and waning nature are described accurately. 

However, the discussion of pyelonephritis is somewhat weak, as it acknowledges CVA tenderness but dismisses it due to the absence of fever and dysuria. This could be seen as not fully supporting the differential diagnosis since CVA tenderness is a significant finding. 

The mention of muscle strain and inguinal hernia is absent, which is a missed opportunity to fully round out the differential diagnosis. 

Overall, the differential diagnosis is mostly accurate and well-supported, but the omission of other potential diagnoses and the somewhat weak justification for pyelonephritis detracts from the overall strength of the argument. 

Given the rubric, this would likely fall into the "3" category: appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: - CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast: This will help show a stone within the renal collecting system. If a stone is present, it can be measured for further evaluation and management. - CBC: Look for elevated leukocytes to evaluate for signs of infection for pyelonephritis - BMP: Patient has had an episode of vomiting, so his electrolyte measures should be evaluated to see for need of fluid or electrolyte replacement. - UA: Patient mentioned urinary urgency. UA is needed to evaluate for blood in urine (which would further support uro/nephrolithiasis) or nitrites/leukocytes to evaluate for possible UTI or pyelonephritis.
Response: The provided plan includes the following tests:

1. **CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast**: This is an acceptable test as it can help identify stones in the renal collecting system.
2. **CBC**: This is a reasonable test to evaluate for signs of infection, although it is not listed as required or acceptable in the rubric.
3. **BMP**: This is an acceptable test, especially given the patient's history of vomiting.
4. **UA**: This is a required test to evaluate for blood in the urine or signs of infection.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and acceptable tests (CT abdomen/pelvis and BMP). However, the inclusion of the CBC, while potentially useful, is not necessary for the core evaluation of the patient's symptoms and introduces an unnecessary test into the plan. 

Since the plan includes the essential UA and acceptable tests but also adds a test that is not required or listed as acceptable, it falls into the category of a "reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests."

Based on the rubric, I would score this plan as a 3.

FMH: Mom had a cholecystectomy for cholecystitis. ROS: Negative for fevers, headaches, diarrhea, chest pain, or SOB. 

Physical Examination:
Vitals: T: 99.7, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, O2: 99% on RA General: Sitting up in chair, no acute distress. HEENT: No cervical lymphadenopathy. Normal dentition. Tonsils absent. Cardio: RRR, no M/R/G appreciated. No lower extremity edema. 2+ posterior tibial pulses. Respiratory: bilateral breath sounds with no wheezes, stridor, rhonchi, or crackles Abdomen: Bowel sounds heard. No tenderness to palpation of abdomen. No guarding. Right CVA tenderness. MSK: No skin lesions, or abnormal bruising noted. Neuro: PERRLA. EOM intact.

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a 49 year old male who presents with (1) acute onset right flank pain that is (2) sharp, (3) radiating to his groin, (4) associated with urinary urgency and has (5) right CVA tenderness on exam.

Differential Diagnosis:
Ddx: 1. Urolithiasis 2. Nephrolithiasis 3. Pyelonephritis

Supporting Information:
1 and 2. Urolithiasis and Nephrolithiasis: Patient presents with an acute onset waxing and waning, sharp, right flank pain with associated CVA tenderness and radiation to groin. With his history of gout, he is at increased risk of uro- and nephrolithiasis. His presentation is classic for a stone. As he is having waxing and waning symptoms, it could be within the ureters, and is increasing in pain with peristalsis of ureters. Similarly it could be within his kidneys. 3. Pyelonephritis: While patient does have CVA tenderness on exam and is expressing some urinary urgency, he is afebrile and does not note dysuria. Likely the urinary urgency comes from a stone and not pyelonephritis. 

Plan:
- CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast: This will help show a stone within the renal collecting system. If a stone is present, it can be measured for further evaluation and management. - CBC: Look for elevated leukocytes to evaluate for signs of infection for pyelonephritis - BMP: Patient has had an episode of vomiting, so his electrolyte measures should be evaluated to see for need of fluid or electrolyte replacement. - UA: Patient mentioned urinary urgency. UA is needed to evaluate for blood in urine (which would further support uro/nephrolithiasis) or nitrites/leukocytes to evaluate for possible UTI or pyelonephritis.


Response: The organization of the provided note is generally strong. The information is presented in clear sections, which include the History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section is labeled appropriately, and the content within each section is logically ordered, making it easy to follow the patient's case.

- The HPI clearly outlines the patient's chief complaint and provides relevant details about the onset, character, and associated symptoms of the pain.
- The Physical Examination section is well-structured, presenting vital signs and findings in an organized manner.
- The Summary concisely encapsulates the key points from the HPI and Physical Exam.
- The Differential Diagnosis is listed clearly, and the Supporting Information provides a rationale for each diagnosis.
- The Plan section is straightforward and outlines the next steps in a logical order.

There are no apparent issues with disorganization, repetition, or missing sections. Therefore, based on the rubric, this note demonstrates that all features are organized, with information presented in appropriate sections.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI: Patient is a 63 year old male presenting to the emergency department with complaints of flank pain over the last 24 hours. Patient states that there was no acute inciting event, however he was at the gym for the first time recently and used a foam roller. He states that his pain comes in waves that last 2-20 minutes in duration, at which time he is unable to get comfortable and rates the pain as 9/10 in intensity. The pain is mainly described as sharp and spasm-like with radiation to the groin. The pain is associated with nausea and vomiting due to its severity and Mr. Ryan has vomited twice in the last 24 hours. He has been able to drink, but has a reduced appetite. There are no relieving factors, however he has tried Tylenol without much effect on the pain. Also states that he has had burning with urination and frequent urination over the last day. Patient reports drinking 4 glasses of water per day at baseline. ROS: Negative for fever, chills, diarrhea/constipation, blood in stool, hematuria, positive for nausea, vomiting, dysuria, pain with urination PMH: Gout, currently unmedicated/untreated without recent flares PSH: Works at office, goes home and goes to bed. Past surgical history: No surgeries reported Family history: Mother with cholelithiasis 
Response: To evaluate the HPI provided, let's break down the key components against the rubric criteria:

1. **Key Information Present**: The HPI mentions flank pain, its duration (24 hours), and describes the nature of the pain (sharp, spasms, 9/10 severity). It also includes associated symptoms like nausea and vomiting, which are important for understanding the patient's condition. The mention of dysuria and urgency is present, but the detail about hematuria is noted as absent, which is a pertinent negative.

2. **Conciseness and Organization**: The information is generally organized, detailing the pain characteristics first, followed by associated symptoms and relevant past medical history. However, there are some extraneous details included (like the mention of the gym and foam roller) that do not directly contribute to the understanding of the current issue.

3. **Missing Pertinent Negatives**: The HPI does not mention hematuria, which is a key negative finding that should be included. It also lacks some details about the nature of the vomiting (specifically that it is nonbloody/nonbilious).

4. **Accuracy**: The documented history appears accurate, and the patient’s experience aligns with the symptoms described.

Given these points, while the HPI includes many key details and is mostly organized, it lacks some pertinent negatives and includes some irrelevant information. Therefore, it would be rated as follows:

- Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, but missing some pertinent negatives.

Based on this assessment, the score for this HPI is:

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: T: 99.7 degrees, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, O2 st: 99% ORA HEENT: No erythema of nares, oropharynx, sclera, no exudate in tonsils Lymph: no cervical/sub occipital lymphadenopathy CV: heart regular rhythm and rate Resp- Normal chest expansion, lungs clear to auscultation BL ABD- No abdominal tenderness, no suprapubic discomfort, no visible deformity, no masses palpated, normal bowel sounds, R flank tenderness, mild paraspinal tenderness on the R side. No visible deformity on spine, stepoff. Neuro: Gait normal, EOMI
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, let's break down the documentation:

1. **Normal vitals:** The vitals provided are normal (T: 99.7 degrees, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, O2 saturation: 99% ORA). This part is documented well and meets the criteria for normal findings.

2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness:** The documentation states "R flank tenderness," which suggests a positive finding for costovertebral angle tenderness. However, it is not explicitly labeled as such. 

3. **No abdominal tenderness:** The note states "No abdominal tenderness," which meets the criterion for documenting this negative finding.

4. **Organization and conciseness:** The exam findings are generally well organized under different systems (HEENT, Lymph, CV, Resp, ABD, Neuro). However, there is some disorganization regarding the abdominal findings, as "R flank tenderness" is mentioned alongside multiple negative findings without clear delineation.

5. **Missing pertinent negatives:** While the note documents several negative findings, it does not mention any pertinent negatives for the respiratory or cardiovascular systems, such as absence of wheezing or murmurs.

Considering these points, the documentation includes most key physical exam findings and is generally well organized, but it lacks explicit labeling of the positive costovertebral angle tenderness and some pertinent negatives. Therefore, it fits best into the "3" category of the rubric.

Final score: 3

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Patient is a 63 year old male presenting to the emergency department with 24 hours of flank pain, nausea/vomiting and dysuria. 
Response: To evaluate the provided patient note against the rubric:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The note mentions "24 hours of flank pain," which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The note states "flank pain," but it does not specify that it is on the right side. This is a missing essential element.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: There is no mention of the intensity of the pain, which is another missing essential element.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: There is no mention of spasms, colic, or waves of pain, which is yet another missing essential element.
5. **Optional elements**: The note mentions "nausea/vomiting," which is an optional element, but it does not mention any of the other optional elements (right groin pain or afebrile).

In summary, the note is missing multiple essential elements (specifically, the location of the flank pain, the intensity of the pain, and the description of the pain). Therefore, this note would receive a score of 2 according to the rubric.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1)Nephrolithiasis 3) Paraspinal muscle strain 2)Uncomplicated cystitis 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, let's break it down according to the rubric.

1) Nephrolithiasis: This is the most relevant diagnosis considering the symptoms are likely related to renal issues, which aligns well with the answer key.
2) Uncomplicated cystitis: This is a reasonable alternative diagnosis, as it is consistent with urinary symptoms, though it is not as specific as UTI/pyelonephritis. However, it is still a valid consideration.
3) Paraspinal muscle strain: This optional diagnosis is less relevant compared to the first two. While muscle strain could cause pain, it does not directly relate to the urinary symptoms and is not prioritized correctly in relation to the other conditions.

Overall, the differential diagnosis includes relevant conditions but has a minor flaw in prioritization by including a less relevant diagnosis (muscle strain) and not including pyelonephritis, which is a more serious condition related to the urinary tract.

Based on the rubric:
- The first diagnosis is strong and relevant.
- The second diagnosis is generally consistent but not the best choice.
- The third diagnosis is less relevant and should not be prioritized.

Thus, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings but has some flaws in prioritization. Therefore, I would score this section as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1) Based on history of acute onset flank pain with spasms that is rated 9/10, radiation to groin, history of unmedicated gout, dysuria, I would be concerned with nephrolithiasis/kidney stones. On exam, there is evidence of CVA tenderness. No other abdominal pain to palpation. No suprapubic pain, concerns of fever, chills, no acute inciting event. 2) Based on acute onset flank pain with spasms that is rated 9/10, history of using foam roller at the gym, paraspinal tenderness there is some concern for muscle strain. The lack of inciting event and positive CVA tenderness on exam, radiation to the groin make this less likely. 3) Based on the onset of frequent urination, burning with urination, there is some concern for cystitis. Based on the patient's history of CVA tenderness, 9/10 flank pain, lack of fever/chills this is less likely. 
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), muscle strain, and cystitis. 

1) The first part effectively identifies nephrolithiasis as the primary concern, supported by acute onset flank pain, pain rating, and history of gout. It also acknowledges the presence of CVA tenderness, which is relevant for pyelonephritis but does not provide clear links to that diagnosis. Overall, this section is well-supported, but it lacks a complete connection to all relevant diagnoses.

2) The second part discusses muscle strain and provides some rationale, noting the acute onset and paraspinal tenderness. However, it correctly points out that the presence of CVA tenderness and radiation to the groin make muscle strain less likely. This section is appropriately supported but does not fully connect to other potential diagnoses.

3) The third part mentions cystitis but does not make a strong connection to the patient's symptoms of flank pain and CVA tenderness. It recognizes that cystitis is less likely given the clinical picture but does not provide a strong link to the diagnosis itself.

Overall, the student presents a differential diagnosis that is mostly supported with some correct links, but there are some inaccuracies and incomplete connections that could impact patient care. Therefore, the score for this section would be a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1) Nephrolithiasis: Will obtain Urinalysis to look for evidence of hematuria indicating stone. Will obtain CT abdomen and pelvis to asses for stone lodged in ureter/renal pelvis, will also assess features of stone including size, location Will obtain CBC/CMP to ensure patient has no markers of infection (WBC), signs of acute kidney injury (Creatinine) . 
Response: The plan provided includes the following components:

1. **Urinalysis (UA)** - This is required and appropriate for assessing hematuria related to nephrolithiasis.
2. **CT abdomen and pelvis** - This is acceptable for assessing the presence of stones and their characteristics.
3. **CBC/CMP** - While a CBC is acceptable for checking for signs of infection, a CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel) is not explicitly listed as acceptable in the rubric. The BMP (Basic Metabolic Panel) would be more appropriate for assessing renal function and electrolytes.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and an acceptable CT scan. However, the inclusion of the CBC/CMP introduces an unnecessary component since the CMP is not specified in the acceptable tests. 

Considering this evaluation, the plan is reasonable but includes some unnecessary tests (the CMP). Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for an effective and efficient plan.

Based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 3 for this plan.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 53M without PMH or PSH who presents to the ED today with chief complaint of right flank pain. States the pain started suddenly yesterday, is intermittent in nature and ranges from a 2/10 in intensity to a 10/10. The 10/10 pain lasts from 20 min to an hour before subsiding to a lower intensity. He has tried Tylenol without relief. States he did return to the gym two days ago after an extended break from exercise and worked out using rowing equipment. Reports flank pain not worse with movement, dysuria. Denies fever, cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing, abdominal complaints, changes in stool. PMH none PSH none Medications none Allergies NKDA FHx Mother with cholecystectomy. Father with T2DM, HTN. Siblings without PMH. SHx Never smoker, moderate EtOH use, no illicit substance use Lives with his wife at their home. Works as an insurance agent. 
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI against the rubric criteria, we can analyze the following key components:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does mention right flank pain, which is a key symptom.
2. **Duration**: The onset is described as "suddenly yesterday," which aligns with the requirement for the acute nature of the pain.
3. **Character of pain**: The pain is described as "intermittent in nature," but it does not explicitly state whether it is sharp, which is a key descriptor in the rubric.
4. **Pain severity**: The patient provides a range of pain intensity from 2/10 to 10/10, which does not adhere to the requirement of stating a severe pain level (9/10). The description of the duration of severe pain (20 min to an hour) is also missing from the rubric.
5. **Associated symptoms**: The patient reports dysuria, which is relevant, but does not mention urgency. Nausea and vomiting are also not documented.
6. **Pertinent negatives**: The patient denies hematuria, which is a pertinent negative that is documented, but other negatives such as nausea and vomiting are omitted.

Overall, while some key information is present, there are several omissions and a lack of organization in the HPI. The character of pain is not fully described, and important associated symptoms are missing. Hence, this HPI would fall into the category of having many key historical findings omitted and being poorly documented.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: 53 year old male with 1 day history of sudden onset intermittent right sided flank pain up to 10/10 intensity, dysuria, with history of recent return to exercise. 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric criteria and the answer key.

1. The statement mentions "sudden onset" which aligns with "acute onset OR past 24 hours."
2. "Right sided flank pain" corresponds to "right flank pain."
3. The intensity is described as "up to 10/10 intensity," which meets the criteria for "10/10 intensity OR severe intensity."
4. The term "intermittent" does not match the required elements of "spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves." Therefore, this element is missing.
5. The statement does not include any optional elements, such as "non-bilious vomiting," "right groin pain," or "afebrile."

Based on the rubric:
- The summary includes 3 essential elements (acute onset, right flank pain, and 10/10 intensity).
- It is missing one essential element (spasms or colic).
- The statement contains more than 5 total elements (it includes additional information like "dysuria" and "history of recent return to exercise").

According to the rubric:
- The note is missing 1 essential element and has more than 5 total elements.

Thus, the score for this summary is 3.

2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Kidney stone 2. UTI 3. Muscle strain
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes:

1. Kidney stone (nephrolithiasis/renal colic) - This is a correct interpretation of the findings.
2. UTI (urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis) - This is also a correct interpretation of the findings.
3. Muscle strain - This is an optional diagnosis and while it may not be directly related to the primary symptoms, it does not significantly detract from the overall assessment.

The differential diagnosis reflects a good understanding of the potential conditions based on the symptoms presented by the patient. The prioritization of kidney stones and UTI is accurate, as these are common and relevant conditions for the symptoms described. The inclusion of muscle strain, while optional, does not negatively impact patient care.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings, with minor flaws in prioritization due to the optional nature of the muscle strain.

Based on the rubric:
- The differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Kidney stone Pain is intermittent, was sudden onset. Reports dysuria. Pain not relieved by Tylenol. No fever, CVA TTP present. 2. UTI Reports dysuria, CVA TTP present. Less likely d/t intermittent nature of pain and lack of infectious markers (fever, tachycardia). 3. Muscle strain Reports right flank pain, recently returned to gym. Pain fits pattern of strain + spasm. Less likely in presence of dysuria with sudden onset nature and not worsened by physical movement. 
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes kidney stone, UTI, and muscle strain, with some reasoning for each. Let's evaluate the support for each diagnosis based on the rubric:

1. **Kidney stone**: The note mentions intermittent pain, sudden onset, and dysuria. However, the presence of CVA tenderness and the absence of fever are noted. This is a reasonable connection to nephrolithiasis but could be more complete by mentioning the severity of the pain (which is noted as not relieved by Tylenol). The link is mostly correct, but the dysuria is more suggestive of a UTI than a kidney stone.

2. **UTI**: The reasoning here is appropriate as it acknowledges the presence of dysuria and CVA tenderness. However, it correctly points out that the intermittent nature of the pain and lack of infectious markers make it less likely. This is a well-supported differential diagnosis.

3. **Muscle strain**: The rationale provided notes the right flank pain and recent physical activity, which aligns well with a muscle strain. However, the reasoning could be strengthened by explicitly stating how the sudden onset and dysuria make this diagnosis less likely. 

Overall, the differential diagnosis is reasonably supported, but there are some gaps, particularly in the kidney stone reasoning and the muscle strain explanation. The links to the diagnoses are mostly correct but not fully complete. 

Based on the rubric, this would fall under category 3: "Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care."

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: UA to r/o UTI and check for RBCs KUB, may confirm presence of stone Management for muscle strain would be conservative so no further w/o need to r/o. 
Response: The plan includes a urinalysis (UA) to rule out a urinary tract infection (UTI) and check for red blood cells (RBCs), which aligns with the required test. However, the mention of "KUB" (Kidneys, Ureters, Bladder) could be interpreted as an abdominal X-ray, which is not listed in the acceptable tests and could be considered unnecessary depending on the context. The plan does not mention any of the acceptable tests such as a CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, or renal ultrasound, which could have been beneficial for thoroughness.

The plan also states that management for muscle strain would be conservative and implies no further workup is needed to rule out other conditions, which may suggest a lack of comprehensive evaluation for potential underlying issues.

Overall, while the UA is appropriate, the inclusion of KUB and the lack of other acceptable tests along with the conservative approach for muscle strain leads to an ineffective plan with missed essential tests.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Patient is a 56 year old male with PMH of Gout. He presents with a 24 hour history of acute-onset R flank pain that occurred "out of the blue" while he was sitting down. The pain is in the R flank and radiates to the groin. He rates the pain as a 9/10 and sharp when he has an episode of pain, which occurs every 30 minutes and lasts for about 10 minutes. He has experienced nausea and 2 episodes of vomiting due to the pain. He denies any pain like this before. He has not had any change in appetite, bowel function, bladder function. He has taken some OTC Tylenol in an attempt to manage pain, but states it has not helped. Patient says he recently started a new workout routine and experienced some discomfort in the flank last week after a rowing workout. Denies chest pain, headache, fever. ROS: As per hpi PMH: Gout Surgical: N/a Meds: Tylenol FH: Mother had a cholecystectomy, father has HX of diabetes, pt unsure if T1 or T2. Social: He works as an insurance agent, denies hx of smoking, illicit drug use, drinks one alcoholic drink/month. Drinks up to 3 soft drinks/day, states he does not drink much water
Response: The provided HPI includes several key components, but there are some omissions and areas where organization could be improved. 

1. **Key Information Present**: The patient’s acute right flank pain is documented, including the duration (24 hours), the nature of the pain (sharp), and its severity (9/10). However, the description of the pain episodes occurring every 30 minutes rather than 1-2 hours does not align with the answer key, which specifies spasms or colic every 1-2 hours.

2. **Nausea and Vomiting**: The patient reports nausea and vomiting, which is aligned with the answer key, but it lacks specification that the vomiting was clear or nonbloody/nonbilious.

3. **Dysuria and Urgency**: While the patient denies changes in bladder function, the specific mention of dysuria or urgency is absent. The answer key indicates that this should be included.

4. **Hematuria**: The patient denies hematuria, which is good; however, this information is not explicitly stated in the HPI.

5. **Overall Organization**: The HPI is generally organized, but the inclusion of extraneous details, such as the patient’s past workouts and family history, could lead to some disorganization in focusing on the key elements of the current presentation.

Given these points, the HPI is missing some pertinent negatives and does not fully adhere to the structure suggested by the rubric. Therefore, it falls into the category of "most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives."

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Temp: 99.7 HR: 85 RR:16 BP: 128/82 Oxygen: 99% on RA Gen: Well appearing middle aged male in moderate discomfort Cardio: Regular rate, rhythm Pulm: Lungs clear to auscultation BIL. HEENT: Moist mucous membranes, good dentition, no Jaundice ABD: Normoactive bowel sounds, + Murphy sign, -psoas sign, moderate RLQ, RUQ tenderness. Patient endorses R flank pain MSK: 5/5 symmetrical strength U/L ext Psych: A&O, appropriate affect 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to assess the completeness, organization, and relevance of the information presented.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs provided (Temp: 99.7, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, Oxygen: 99% on RA) are indeed normal or within acceptable ranges for a physical exam. This part is present.

2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The note does not explicitly mention costovertebral angle tenderness, which is a key finding for renal issues. However, the note indicates "moderate RLQ, RUQ tenderness" and that the patient endorses right flank pain, which may imply some form of tenderness, but it's not specifically stated.

3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The findings indicate "moderate RLQ, RUQ tenderness" and a positive Murphy sign, which suggests the presence of abdominal tenderness, contradicting the requirement of documenting "no abdominal tenderness."

Overall, while the physical exam findings are somewhat organized and include important information, they are missing the explicit documentation of costovertebral angle tenderness and incorrectly state the absence of abdominal tenderness. 

Based on the rubric:
- The presence of some key findings is noted, but the omission of specific details and the incorrect documentation of abdominal tenderness detracts from the overall quality of the physical exam documentation.

Considering these points, I would assign a score of 2 for this section.

3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Patient is a 56 year old male with acute-onset 9/10 R flank pain radiating to the groin.
Response: To evaluate the provided statement against the rubric and the answer key:

1. The statement mentions "acute-onset," which satisfies the first essential element.
2. It includes "R flank pain," which satisfies the second essential element.
3. The pain intensity is described as "9/10," which does not meet the requirement of "10/10 intensity OR severe intensity." Therefore, this element is missing.
4. The statement does not mention spasms, colic, or that the pain comes in waves, which means this essential element is also missing.

The optional elements are not addressed in the statement.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Essential elements present: 2 (acute-onset, R flank pain)
- Missing essential elements: 2 (pain intensity, spasms/colic)
- Total elements: 4 (acute-onset, R flank pain, 9/10 intensity, radiating to the groin)

According to the rubric:
- The statement is missing multiple essential elements.

Based on this analysis, the score for this section is:

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1: Nephrolithiasis 2: Cholecystitis 3: Appendicitis 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided:

1. Nephrolithiasis is the primary concern and aligns perfectly with the patient's symptoms, which is a strong point.
2. Cholecystitis is not directly relevant to the symptoms typically associated with nephrolithiasis and does not correlate with findings related to kidney stones.
3. Appendicitis is also not relevant unless there are specific symptoms indicating abdominal pain that could suggest this condition, which is typically not related to nephrolithiasis.

The differential diagnosis includes one pertinent diagnosis (nephrolithiasis) and two that are not consistent with the findings. Therefore, the overall differential diagnosis is somewhat consistent but overly broad and inaccurately prioritized since the other two conditions do not reflect the symptoms related to the patient's primary concern.

Based on the rubric, this would fall into the category of "somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized."

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1: Patient has acute onset sharp pain in the R flank that radiates to the groin, he drinks >20 soft drinks a week, has recently started exercising, and does not drink much water. He has never had sx like this before. He has a past medical history of gout. These findings suggest he may have Kidney stones. 2: Patient does have RUQ pain and a + Murphy sign. The pain is not associated with meals and has never happened before. A RUQ ultrasound is easy to perform since we will already be performing a KUB ultrasound. 3: Patient does endorse RLQ pain, which could be due to the path of the ureter, but it could be due to appendicitis, he does have a - psoas sign, making it less likely, but will be good to check a lipase/amylase in the event that KUB and RUQ ultrasound come back inconclusive 
Response: To evaluate the provided support for the differential diagnosis based on the rubric, let's break down the information given:

1. **Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis)**: 
   - The patient has acute onset sharp pain in the right flank that radiates to the groin, which aligns well with the symptoms of kidney stones. 
   - The mention of drinking >20 soft drinks a week and not drinking much water suggests risk factors for kidney stone formation. 
   - The past medical history of gout is relevant as it can be associated with certain types of kidney stones. 
   - Overall, this section supports the diagnosis of kidney stones effectively.

2. **UTI/Pyelonephritis**: 
   - The mention of RUQ pain and a positive Murphy sign is not directly related to the differential diagnosis of kidney stones but indicates a potential issue with the gallbladder or liver. 
   - The pain not being associated with meals and having never occurred before does not strongly link to UTI or pyelonephritis, as there are missing key symptoms such as dysuria or urgency. 
   - Thus, this section does not provide appropriate support for the diagnosis of UTI or pyelonephritis.

3. **Muscle strain**: 
   - The mention of RLQ pain could suggest a muscle strain, but it is not a strong link to the findings presented earlier regarding kidney stones. 
   - The reference to the psoas sign being negative does help rule out appendicitis, but it does not effectively support the diagnosis of muscle strain or kidney stones.
   - The suggestion to check lipase/amylase is reasonable but does not provide strong support for the differential diagnosis of kidney stones.

Overall, the differential diagnosis for kidney stones is well supported in the first part, but the other sections do not provide strong or appropriate links to the initial diagnosis. The support for kidney stones is strong, while the support for UTI and muscle strain is weak and lacks accurate links.

Based on the rubric:
- The first section supports the diagnosis well.
- The second and third sections do not appropriately support the differential diagnosis.

Given the overall assessment, I would score this as a 3, as it is appropriately supported with some missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CBC Bilirubin Urinalysis Ultrasound of Kidney, bladder, ureter Ultrasound of RUQ/RLQ Amylase, Lipase If all other imaging is inconclusive, CT abd/pelvis to evaluate appendicitis 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, let's break down the components against the rubric criteria:

1. **Required Tests**: The plan includes "Urinalysis," which is a required test.
2. **Acceptable Tests**: "Ultrasound of Kidney, bladder, ureter" and "CT abdomen/pelvis" are acceptable tests. However, the plan also includes "Ultrasound of RUQ/RLQ," "CBC," "Bilirubin," "Amylase," and "Lipase." While some of these tests may be relevant, they are not explicitly listed as required or acceptable in the answer key.
3. **Unacceptable Tests**: There are no unacceptable tests mentioned in the plan.

The plan includes a mix of required and acceptable tests, but it also includes some tests that are not specified as necessary or acceptable, which may indicate unnecessary testing. 

Overall, while the plan does incorporate some essential elements, it also contains tests that may not be justified based on the rubric. The presence of unnecessary tests suggests that the plan is not as efficient as it could be.

Given this analysis, I would assign a score of 2, as the plan is ineffective with essential tests included but also has irrelevant tests.

1) Most features are disorganized, with appropriate sections missing.. Here is the answer key for org: . Please evaluate the following org and provide a score: History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 56 year old male with PMH of Gout. He presents with a 24 hour history of acute-onset R flank pain that occurred "out of the blue" while he was sitting down. The pain is in the R flank and radiates to the groin. He rates the pain as a 9/10 and sharp when he has an episode of pain, which occurs every 30 minutes and lasts for about 10 minutes. He has experienced nausea and 2 episodes of vomiting due to the pain. He denies any pain like this before. He has not had any change in appetite, bowel function, bladder function. He has taken some OTC Tylenol in an attempt to manage pain, but states it has not helped. Patient says he recently started a new workout routine and experienced some discomfort in the flank last week after a rowing workout. Denies chest pain, headache, fever. ROS: As per hpi PMH: Gout Surgical: N/a Meds: Tylenol FH: Mother had a cholecystectomy, father has HX of diabetes, pt unsure if T1 or T2. Social: He works as an insurance agent, denies hx of smoking, illicit drug use, drinks one alcoholic drink/month. Drinks up to 3 soft drinks/day, states he does not drink much water

Physical Examination:
Temp: 99.7 HR: 85 RR:16 BP: 128/82 Oxygen: 99% on RA Gen: Well appearing middle aged male in moderate discomfort Cardio: Regular rate, rhythm Pulm: Lungs clear to auscultation BIL. HEENT: Moist mucous membranes, good dentition, no Jaundice ABD: Normoactive bowel sounds, + Murphy sign, -psoas sign, moderate RLQ, RUQ tenderness. Patient endorses R flank pain MSK: 5/5 symmetrical strength U/L ext Psych: A&O, appropriate affect 

Summary:
Patient is a 56 year old male with acute-onset 9/10 R flank pain radiating to the groin.

Differential Diagnosis:
1: Nephrolithiasis 2: Cholecystitis 3: Appendicitis 

Supporting Information:
1: Patient has acute onset sharp pain in the R flank that radiates to the groin, he drinks >20 soft drinks a week, has recently started exercising, and does not drink much water. He has never had sx like this before. He has a past medical history of gout. These findings suggest he may have Kidney stones. 2: Patient does have RUQ pain and a + Murphy sign. The pain is not associated with meals and has never happened before. A RUQ ultrasound is easy to perform since we will already be performing a KUB ultrasound. 3: Patient does endorse RLQ pain, which could be due to the path of the ureter, but it could be due to appendicitis, he does have a - psoas sign, making it less likely, but will be good to check a lipase/amylase in the event that KUB and RUQ ultrasound come back inconclusive 

Plan:
CBC Bilirubin Urinalysis Ultrasound of Kidney, bladder, ureter Ultrasound of RUQ/RLQ Amylase, Lipase If all other imaging is inconclusive, CT abd/pelvis to evaluate appendicitis 


Response: The organization of the provided note appears to be well-structured, with distinct sections clearly labeled and relevant information grouped appropriately. The History of Present Illness (HPI) is detailed and follows a logical sequence, presenting the patient's symptoms and relevant history. The Physical Examination section is concise and organized, with findings clearly categorized by system. The Summary succinctly encapsulates the main issue, while the Differential Diagnosis is clearly listed and supported by relevant information in the Supporting Information section. The Plan is also clearly delineated, outlining the next steps in a systematic manner. 

Overall, the information is presented in appropriate sections without any apparent disorganization or missing elements.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI: Mr. Ryan is a 56yo male presenting to the ED c/o intermittent right-sided flank pain with radiation down to right groin onset x24hrs ago. Pt reports associated urinary hesitancy and incomplete voiding described as "feeling as if you have to go again right after you pee," that also started at the same time of flank pain. States pain makes him nauseous at times. He has tried OTC Tylenol for pain relief, which has failed to resolve or offer him any relief. His symptoms are not related to PO intakes of certain meals or liquids. ROS: General: Denies any chills or fevers Cardiovascular: No cp, palpitations, or PND Respiratory: Denies cough, SOA, or runny nose GU: No urinary urgency or frequency. Denies dysuria or hematuria Back: Right flank TTP with radiation down to right groin. Abdominal: No TTP in all 6 quadrants. Denies V/D, constipation, or pale stools PMH: Gout PSH: Negative Allergies: NKDA Meds: Tylenol and ibuprofen occasionally Family Hx: Mom-->Cholecystectomy 2/2 cholecystitis Social: No tobacco use, social drinker, no illicit drug use 
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI against the rubric criteria, we can identify several components:

1. **Key Information Present**: The HPI mentions right-sided flank pain, its duration (24 hours), and a description of the pain (intermittent, sharp, radiating to the right groin). However, it does not explicitly state the severity of the pain on a scale (e.g., 9/10), which is a crucial piece of information.

2. **Associated Symptoms**: The patient reports nausea, which is relevant, but the HPI does not clearly state if the nausea is associated with vomiting. The urinary symptoms are described, but the HPI states "urinary hesitancy and incomplete voiding," which does not align with the rubric's mention of dysuria and urgency.

3. **Pertinent Negatives**: The HPI includes some pertinent negatives, such as the absence of hematuria, chills, and fever, but it lacks mention of other key negatives such as the absence of severe pain (9/10) and the nature of the nausea (clear or nonbloody/nonbilious).

4. **Organization and Clarity**: The HPI is generally well-organized, but the mixing of ROS with the HPI can obscure key details. 

Overall, while the HPI contains several relevant details, it is missing key information regarding the severity of pain and the nature of the nausea. Additionally, there are inaccuracies in the description of urinary symptoms. 

Based on these observations, I would score this HPI as a 2, indicating that many key historical findings are omitted and the history is somewhat disorganized.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Temp: 99.7; HR:85; RR:16; BP:128/82; O2: 99% on RA General: Well developed, alert and oriented, no acute distress, appears uncomfortable, speaking in complete sentences HEENT: EOM not intact; impaired left lateral gaze. Posterior oropharynx is without erythema or exudates. Cardio: Trace pitting edema. Regular rate with normal S1 and S2. No murmurs appreciated Resp: Lung fields are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhochi Abdominal: Negative McMurphy's sign, -Rovsing sign, no rebound tenderness, and negative psoas sign. Nondistended, BS are normal Back: Right CVA pain with radiation to right groin. 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric criteria.

1. **Key physical exam findings**:
   - Normal vital signs are documented (Temp, HR, RR, BP, O2).
   - Positive costovertebral angle tenderness is documented (Right CVA pain with radiation to right groin).
   - Abdominal tenderness is addressed with negative findings (no abdominal tenderness, negative McMurphy's sign, -Rovsing sign, no rebound tenderness, and negative psoas sign).

2. **Organization and relevance**:
   - The exam findings are presented in a structured manner, covering different systems (General, HEENT, Cardio, Resp, Abdominal, Back).
   - While most key findings are documented, there are some missing pertinent negatives, particularly in the HEENT and Cardio sections (e.g., the lack of mention of normal findings for other cranial nerves in HEENT and absence of significant findings in the cardiovascular exam).

3. **Conciseness**:
   - The note is somewhat detailed, which may obscure what is key, especially with the inclusion of some findings that could be considered less relevant (e.g., "speaking in complete sentences" under General).

Based on this evaluation, the note contains most of the key positive findings but misses some pertinent negatives and includes some irrelevant details, leading to a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 56yo male c/o right flank pain with radiation to groin and associated urinary symptoms onset x24 hours ago. 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided statement based on the rubric:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - The statement mentions "onset x24 hours ago," which fulfills this requirement.
2. **Right flank pain** - The statement includes "right flank pain," which fulfills this requirement.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - The statement does not specify the intensity of the pain (e.g., 10/10 or severe), so this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - The statement does not mention spasms, colic, or that the pain comes in waves, so this element is also missing.
5. **Optional elements** - The statement does not include any optional elements such as non-bilious vomiting or being afebrile.

In summary, the statement has:
- 2 essential elements present (acute onset and right flank pain).
- 3 essential elements missing (intensity, spasms/colic/waves).
- No optional elements included.

According to the scoring rubric:
- Since there are multiple essential elements missing, the score would be 2.

Final score: 2

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. UTI 2/2 BPH 3. Cholecystitis 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to compare it against the answer key and rubric criteria.

The answer key lists:
1) Nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia

The provided differential diagnosis is:
1. Nephrolithiasis
2. UTI
3. BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)
4. Cholecystitis

Now, let's analyze the provided differential diagnosis:

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: This matches perfectly with the answer key.
2. **UTI**: This also matches with the answer key.
3. **BPH**: This is not listed in the answer key. While it may be relevant in some cases, it does not directly align with the symptoms that would typically lead to this diagnosis based on the context of nephrolithiasis and UTI.
4. **Cholecystitis**: This is also not listed in the answer key and does not seem to be relevant to the symptoms associated with nephrolithiasis or UTI.

Overall, the first two items in the differential diagnosis are correct and relevant, but the inclusion of BPH and cholecystitis introduces inaccuracies. The differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, but the additional items are not prioritized correctly, making it overly broad.

Based on the rubric:
- The first two diagnoses are correct and relevant.
- The additional diagnoses (BPH and cholecystitis) are not consistent with the findings.

Thus, the differential diagnosis is somewhat consistent with findings but overly broad and inaccurately prioritized.

Score: 2

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Acute onset with urinary symptoms; no previous episodes; Right CVA tenderness with radiation to groin; low-grade temp. I would suspect hematuria or dysuria instead of urinary hesitancy/incomplete voiding if this was dx. 2. Urinary symptoms; age of pt. However, abrupt instead of gradual onset make this more unlikely 3. Positive family hx, obese male. However, negative Murphy's sign and no jaundice, pale stools, or hx of biliary colic, and not related to PO intakes
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis based on the provided support, we need to assess how well the findings correlate with the potential diagnoses listed in the answer key.

1. The first point mentions "acute onset with urinary symptoms; no previous episodes; Right CVA tenderness with radiation to groin; low-grade temp." This supports the diagnoses of nephrolithiasis and UTI/pyelonephritis well, as both can present with acute flank pain and urinary symptoms. However, the mention of low-grade temperature could also suggest a more systemic issue, but it doesn't detract from the support for the diagnoses listed.

2. The second point discusses "urinary symptoms; age of pt." This is vague and does not provide strong support for any specific diagnosis. The mention of "abrupt instead of gradual onset" indicates a potential inconsistency with a diagnosis that typically presents gradually, which could weaken the argument for certain conditions but does not outright dismiss them.

3. The third point mentions "positive family hx, obese male" which could support various conditions, but the negative findings for Murphy's sign and the absence of jaundice, pale stools, or biliary colic suggest that certain diagnoses (like gallbladder-related issues) are less likely. However, it doesn't strongly link to the primary conditions being considered.

Overall, the differential diagnosis presented has some appropriate support, particularly for nephrolithiasis and UTI/pyelonephritis, but it lacks complete and clear links to the findings, particularly with the vague second point and the limitations noted in the third point.

Given the rubric:
- The support is somewhat appropriate but has missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care significantly.

Thus, I would score this section as a 3.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. Abdominal X-ray 2. Abdominal non-contrast CT if x-ray non significant 3. UA and urine culture 4. Rectal exam 5. Pain control with NSAIDs 
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup against the rubric, we can break down the elements as follows:

1. **Abdominal X-ray** - This is a reasonable test and could be part of a workup for abdominal pain, but it is not listed as required or acceptable in the answer key.
2. **Abdominal non-contrast CT if x-ray non-significant** - This is acceptable as it is part of a reasonable approach if the X-ray does not yield significant findings.
3. **UA and urine culture** - This is required and essential for evaluating potential urinary issues.
4. **Rectal exam** - While this can be part of a physical examination, it is not specified as a required or acceptable test in the answer key.
5. **Pain control with NSAIDs** - This is a management strategy rather than a diagnostic test and does not contribute to the workup.

Based on the rubric:
- The plan includes essential tests (UA) but also unnecessary tests (Abdominal X-ray and Rectal exam).
- The inclusion of a CT scan contingent on the X-ray results is reasonable, but the initial X-ray is not essential.
- Overall, the plan is somewhat effective but includes unnecessary components.

Thus, the score would be a 2, as it has essential tests missed (not including the UA as the primary focus) and irrelevant tests included (like the X-ray and Rectal exam).

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI: Mr. Nathaniel Ryan is a middle-aged man who presented to the ED today with flank pain. He reports a sudden onset severe pain in his R flank yesterday morning while getting dressed for work. Since that time, he has had 10-12 episodes of severe pain in his R flank that radiate to his groin including overnight. In between episodes he states that he still has pain, but that it is much better. He rates his pain a 2/10 now, but a 10/10 during the previous episodes. He notices that he has had trouble sitting still, but is unsure if moving around makes the pain better. He has tried Tylenol, but has not noticed any improvement in pain. Along with the pain, he becomes nauseous and feels like he is going to vomit, although he has only dry heaved. The nausea improves once the pain subsides. He has noticed that he feels like he needs to urinate much more often during the day, but when he goes to urinate he is only able to pass a small amount of urine. He denies gross hematuria or any pain with urination. He reports going to the gym for the first time a couple days ago, and is wondering if maybe he injured his back somehow. ROS: no fevers, constipation, diarrhea, dysuria, or gross hematuria. Reports nausea, dry heaving, and increased urinary frequency. PMH: gout PSH: none Medications: OTC ibuprofen PRN Allergies: none SH - works for an insurance company, lives at home with his wife, no pets. FH - mom had gallbladder taken out, dad has diabetes and hypertension. 
Response: The HPI provided includes several key elements, but there are some omissions and disorganization that affect the overall clarity and completeness.

1. **Key Information Present**: The patient reports right flank pain, which is sudden in onset, severe (10/10), and has a duration of 24 hours. However, the description of the pain does not explicitly mention "sharp" or "spasms/colic" as outlined in the rubric.
2. **Pain Episodes**: The note mentions multiple episodes of pain and includes a rating of 2/10 when not in severe pain, which is somewhat relevant but does not specifically address the presence of spasms or colic.
3. **Nausea and Vomiting**: The patient reports nausea and dry heaving, which aligns with the rubric, but it does not explicitly state that the vomit is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious.
4. **Dysuria and Urgency**: The patient describes increased urinary frequency and denies hematuria, which is good, but the organization of this information is somewhat scattered throughout the HPI.
5. **Overall Organization**: The HPI is somewhat organized but could benefit from a clearer structure that aligns more closely with the rubric's expectations.

Given these observations, the note captures most of the key historical findings but misses some critical descriptors and lacks a more concise organization. Therefore, it falls into the category of "Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives."

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp 99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, Oxygen 99% on RA Physical Exam: General: appears uncomfortable, unable to sit still HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, no superficial or deep lymph nodes palpable Respiratory: CTAB Cardio: RRR, no murmurs appreciated GI: abdomen non-tender to palpation, bowel sounds present GU: CVA tenderness present on R, pelvic exam deferred. Skin: no rashes present on exposed skin Neuro: AOX3 Psych: mood congruent with affect, answers questions appropriately
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we will analyze the key components mentioned in the answer key:

1. **Normal Vitals**: The student's vital signs indicate a fever (Temp 99.7) which deviates from the normal range. Therefore, this aspect is not consistent with the answer key.

2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The student notes "CVA tenderness present on R," which is consistent with the answer key.

3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The student states "GI: abdomen non-tender to palpation," which aligns with the answer key.

Now, let's assess the overall organization and completeness of the physical exam findings:

- The student provided a comprehensive list of physical exam findings, including a thorough examination of multiple systems. 
- There are some irrelevant details (e.g., "appears uncomfortable, unable to sit still") that may not be necessary for the key physical exam findings.
- The key findings of CVA tenderness and absence of abdominal tenderness are present.
- However, the abnormal vital sign (fever) indicates that not all key physical exam findings are normal, which is a deviation from the answer key.

Considering these points, the documentation is mostly well organized, but the presence of some irrelevant information and the abnormal vital signs affect the completeness of the key findings.

Based on the rubric:
- The student documented most key positive physical exam findings and was organized, but they missed the normality of the vital signs and included some irrelevant details.

Thus, the score for this section is a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Nathaniel Ryan is a middle-aged man with a 1 day history of sudden onset R flank pain that radiates to his groin, R CVA tenderness, increased urinary frequency, and no gross hematuria. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric, let's break down the essential elements present:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "1 day history," which indicates an acute onset.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement specifies "R flank pain."
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not explicitly stated in the summary.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The summary does not mention spasms, colic, or waves of pain.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement includes "R CVA tenderness," "increased urinary frequency," and "no gross hematuria," but these do not replace the essential elements.

Now, let's assess the total elements:
- Essential elements present: 2 (Acute onset and Right flank pain)
- Missing elements: 2 (Intensity and spasms/colic)
- Additional details: 3 optional details (R CVA tenderness, increased urinary frequency, no gross hematuria)

Given that there are 2 essential elements present and 2 missing, the summary statement is missing multiple essential elements. Therefore, according to the rubric:

2) Missing multiple essential elements

Final score: 2

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1) Kidney stone 2) Kidney infection
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes "Kidney stone" and "Kidney infection," which directly correlate with the answer key's items of nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic and UTI/pyelonephritis. The prioritization of these conditions appears to reflect an accurate interpretation of the findings, as kidney stones are a common cause of acute flank pain, while kidney infections can also present with similar symptoms.

Since both items in the differential diagnosis are consistent with the findings and are prioritized appropriately, I would assign a score of 4 for this section.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1) Kidney stones are the most likely diagnosis due to the sudden onset R flank pain that radiates to his groin and increased urinary frequency although passing only small amounts of urine. He is unable to sit still and has had multiple acute episodes of severe pain that last a short time before improving. 2) Kidney infection is on the differential to the R flank pain and CVA tenderness, although less likely due to no dysuria, being afebrile, and the acute onset of intermittent episodes of severe pain. His pain with a kidney infection would likely be more consistent and progress gradually over time. 
Response: In evaluating the differential diagnosis provided:

1) The first part correctly identifies kidney stones as the most likely diagnosis, providing appropriate supporting details such as the sudden onset of right flank pain, the radiation of pain to the groin, and the description of the pain as severe and intermittent. It also mentions increased urinary frequency, which is relevant to nephrolithiasis. This section is well-supported and accurately links the symptoms to the diagnosis, making a strong case for kidney stones.

2) The second part mentions a kidney infection (UTI/pyelonephritis) as a differential diagnosis. While it does note the right flank pain and mentions costovertebral angle tenderness, it appropriately argues against this diagnosis by stating the absence of dysuria and fever, as well as the nature of the pain being intermittent and acute. This shows critical thinking and understanding of how the symptoms align with the differential diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well-supported with accurate links to patient findings. Though the second diagnosis (kidney infection) could be seen as less likely, it is still appropriately included and analyzed. Therefore, the links to the diagnoses are correct and complete.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as a 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CBC/CMP, urinalysis, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and pelvic exam. 
Response: In evaluating the provided plan against the rubric, we see that the required test, urinalysis (UA), is included. However, the plan also includes a CBC/CMP, which is not listed as required or acceptable in the answer key. The CT of the abdomen and pelvis is acceptable, but the pelvic exam is not mentioned in the answer key and is not necessary based on the context provided.

Overall, the plan includes one essential test (UA), one acceptable test (CT abdomen/pelvis), and two tests that are either unnecessary or not mentioned in the answer key (CBC/CMP and pelvic exam). This indicates that the plan is not fully effective and includes irrelevant tests, which aligns with the "shotgunning" concept.

Based on this analysis, the plan is ineffective as it misses some essential tests and includes unnecessary ones.

Physical Examination:
Vitals: Temp 99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, Oxygen 99% on RA Physical Exam: General: appears uncomfortable, unable to sit still HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, no superficial or deep lymph nodes palpable Respiratory: CTAB Cardio: RRR, no murmurs appreciated GI: abdomen non-tender to palpation, bowel sounds present GU: CVA tenderness present on R, pelvic exam deferred. Skin: no rashes present on exposed skin Neuro: AOX3 Psych: mood congruent with affect, answers questions appropriately

Summary:
Mr. Nathaniel Ryan is a middle-aged man with a 1 day history of sudden onset R flank pain that radiates to his groin, R CVA tenderness, increased urinary frequency, and no gross hematuria. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1) Kidney stone 2) Kidney infection

Supporting Information:
1) Kidney stones are the most likely diagnosis due to the sudden onset R flank pain that radiates to his groin and increased urinary frequency although passing only small amounts of urine. He is unable to sit still and has had multiple acute episodes of severe pain that last a short time before improving. 2) Kidney infection is on the differential to the R flank pain and CVA tenderness, although less likely due to no dysuria, being afebrile, and the acute onset of intermittent episodes of severe pain. His pain with a kidney infection would likely be more consistent and progress gradually over time. 

Plan:
CBC/CMP, urinalysis, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and pelvic exam. 


Response: The organization of the provided note is quite structured and follows a logical format, with clear delineation between sections such as History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section contains relevant information that pertains to the patient's case, and there is no significant repetition or misplaced information. 

While the note is comprehensive, it could benefit from a little more clarity in the organization of the Review of Systems (ROS) and the Past Medical History (PMH) sections, as they seem to blend into the HPI rather than being distinctly separated. However, the overall organization is strong.

Given these observations, I would score this section as follows:

3) Most features are organized with information presented in appropriate sections.

1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle aged male patient that presents to the ED with 24 hour history of right flank pain. - Pain started abruptly yesterday and is sharp, 9/10 pain at its maximum. He compared the pain quality as to his mom's gallstones. - Radiates around his right flank to involve right groin. - Denies hematuria, but has noticed increased dysuria over the past day. - No association with meals or other activity. - No previous episodes of kidney stones or pain like this in the past. - Tylenol and Ibuprofen have minimally relieved the pain. - Worked out day prior to pain onset. - Current pain rating is 3/10. - Sexually active with no prior STIs ROS: Negative other than stated in HPI. PMH: Gout 2 years ago Surgical Hx: Possible appendicitis as child Family Hx: Mother had gallstones; Father has hypertension and diabetes Social Hx: Never smoker. Drinks 1 beer per month. Meds: OTC Tylenol and Ibuprofen Allergy: NKDA
Response: In evaluating the provided history of present illness (HPI) against the rubric, several key components are present:

1. **Right flank pain**: Clearly stated as a 24-hour history, which is essential.
2. **Pain characteristics**: Described as sharp and rated at 9/10 at its maximum, which aligns with the rubric's requirement.
3. **Pain pattern**: Mention of spasms or colic every 1-2 hours is missing, though the patient does describe the pain radiating to the right groin.
4. **Nausea and vomiting**: There is mention of dysuria, but nausea and vomiting are not explicitly stated in the HPI.
5. **Dysuria and urgency**: Dysuria is mentioned, but urgency is not specifically addressed.
6. **Hematuria**: The patient denies hematuria, which is included.
7. **Other relevant history**: The patient’s previous episodes of kidney stones and associated factors are noted, but the lack of nausea and vomiting and the missing detail about spasms or colic detracts from completeness.

Overall, while the HPI contains significant information and is mostly organized, it omits some key details, particularly regarding nausea/vomiting and the specific mention of spasms/colic. Therefore, it does not achieve the highest score but is still fairly comprehensive.

Based on the rubric, this HPI would score a 3, as it contains most key positive historical findings but is missing some pertinent negatives.

2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp: 99.7F (afebrile) HR:85 RR:16 BP: 128/82 Oxygen: 99% on RA General: Well appearing male patient sitting on exam table with moderate discomfort and breathing normally on RA. HEENT: Oropharynx and dentition normal on exam. PERRL. Neck: No cervical lymphadenopathy Respiratory: CTAB CV: Regular rate and rhythm. Abdominal: Normal on inspection. No tenderness to light or deep palpation. Positive rebound tenderness on right lower quadrant. Negative Rovsing's, Murphy's, and Psoas signs. Normal to percussion. Bowel sounds present. Back: CVA tenderness to palpation bilaterally, worse on right. 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, let's break down the key components.

1. **Normal vitals**: The vital signs are documented, but the temperature is slightly elevated (99.7F), which may not be considered completely normal. However, the other vitals appear normal, but the presence of a fever could be significant.

2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The note states "CVA tenderness to palpation bilaterally, worse on right," which indicates a positive finding for CVA tenderness.

3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The note mentions "No tenderness to light or deep palpation" but also states "Positive rebound tenderness on right lower quadrant." This indicates that while there is no tenderness on palpation, there is a significant finding (positive rebound tenderness) that suggests abdominal issues.

Considering these points:
- The vital signs are mostly normal, but the temperature indicates a potential issue.
- The CVA tenderness is correctly noted.
- The abdominal findings are somewhat contradictory; while there is no tenderness to palpation, the presence of rebound tenderness indicates significant abdominal discomfort, which is an important finding that should be highlighted.

Overall, the physical exam findings include key components, but there are some discrepancies and a lack of clarity regarding abdominal tenderness. Thus, the documentation is somewhat disorganized due to the conflicting information about abdominal tenderness.

Based on the rubric:
- The presence of relevant findings is there, but the contradictory nature of the abdominal findings and the slight issue with the vital signs indicates that not all key findings are accurately documented or organized.

Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric and the answer key, we need to identify the essential elements present and assess if any are missing.

1. Acute onset - This is present ("acute onset").
2. Right flank pain - This is present ("right flank pain").
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity - This is missing; the statement does not specify the intensity of the pain.
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves - This is missing; the statement does not describe the nature of the pain as spasms or colic.
5. Optional elements - Non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, or afebrile - "radiates to the right groin" is present, but "associated dysuria" does not count as one of the optional elements.

In summary, the statement includes 2 essential elements (acute onset and right flank pain) but misses 2 essential elements (intensity and nature of pain). Therefore, it is missing multiple essential elements.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: This is consistent with the symptoms typically associated with kidney stones, such as flank pain and hematuria. It is a relevant diagnosis given the context.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: This condition can also be consistent with urinary symptoms and flank pain, making it a valid consideration in the differential diagnosis.

3. **Appendicitis**: This diagnosis is less relevant if the primary symptoms do not include right lower quadrant pain or gastrointestinal symptoms. If the patient did not report these symptoms, then this diagnosis would be considered inconsistent with the findings.

In summary, the first two diagnoses (nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis) are pertinent and prioritized correctly, reflecting a good interpretation of the findings. However, the inclusion of appendicitis introduces an inconsistency, as it may not be supported by the reported symptoms.

Given this analysis, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings but includes one diagnosis (appendicitis) that is not supported by the evidence, which affects the overall prioritization. Therefore, the score would reflect that there are minor flaws in prioritization.

I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis: - CVA tenderness on exam - Pain is episodic with colic that is typical for kidney stones - Dysuria present - PMH positive for gout, which increases chances for kidney stones due to increased circulating uric acid. 2. Pyelonephritis: - CVA tenderness on exam with dysuria - Not as likely because no fever and onset is acute 3. Appendicitis: - Patient unsure of prior surgery for appendectomy - Rebound tenderness present in RLQ - Not as likely given possibility of surgery in past, negative psoas sign, negative Rosvings sign. - No decreased appetite, which makes this less likely. 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, let's break down the support for each diagnosis according to the rubric.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: 
   - The note mentions costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness, which is relevant and supports the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis. 
   - The description of pain being episodic and colicky aligns well with typical kidney stone symptoms.
   - The presence of dysuria is noted, which is not typical for nephrolithiasis but could be explained if there's some irritation in the urinary tract.
   - The past medical history (PMH) of gout is correctly linked to an increased risk for kidney stones due to elevated uric acid levels.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: 
   - The CVA tenderness is also relevant here, and the presence of dysuria supports it.
   - The note correctly states that pyelonephritis is less likely due to the absence of fever and the acute onset, which is a reasonable conclusion.

3. **Appendicitis**: 
   - The mention of rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) is a classic sign of appendicitis.
   - The uncertainty about a prior appendectomy adds a layer of complexity, but it's appropriately noted that this makes the diagnosis less likely.
   - The negative psoas and Rosving's signs and lack of decreased appetite are also rational points that decrease the likelihood of appendicitis.

Overall, the differential diagnoses presented are well-supported, with appropriate reasoning for each diagnosis. However, the inclusion of dysuria in nephrolithiasis is somewhat misleading, as it is not typically associated with kidney stones. Still, the reasoning is mostly sound, and the links to the findings are mostly correct and complete.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as a 3 because it is appropriately supported but contains a minor error regarding the link of dysuria to nephrolithiasis that does not significantly impact patient care.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. Urinalysis with reflex urine culture 2. Abdominal CT with no contrast (stone protocol) 3. CBC/CMP 4. Urine PCR for chlamydia/gonorrhea 5. Obtain prior surgical records to see if he had appendectomy.
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup against the rubric:

1. **Urinalysis with reflex urine culture** - This is a required test, so it is appropriate.
2. **Abdominal CT with no contrast (stone protocol)** - This is an acceptable test, as it can help identify potential stones or other abdominal issues.
3. **CBC/CMP** - While this test can provide useful information, it is not listed in the required or acceptable categories, making it unnecessary for this specific workup.
4. **Urine PCR for chlamydia/gonorrhea** - This test is also not mentioned in the acceptable or required categories, so it may be considered unnecessary for this workup.
5. **Obtain prior surgical records to see if he had appendectomy** - While this is not a test, obtaining prior surgical records can be valuable for context, but it does not directly contribute to the diagnostic workup.

In summary, the plan includes the required UA and an acceptable CT, but also includes unnecessary tests (CBC/CMP and Urine PCR). The presence of unnecessary tests indicates that the plan is reasonable but not efficient.

Based on the rubric:
- The plan includes most essential tests but also includes some unnecessary tests.

Therefore, I would score this plan a 3.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 56 yo M here in the ER for flank pain that seems to move down to his groin at times. He reports this started a day or 2 ago. Reports constant dull pain present at all times he rates a 2/10 and intermittent sharp stabbing pain he rates a 10-15/10. Reports the intense pain can last an hour or 2 then go away for a while. Has tried tylenol and has not helped. Nothing seems to make pain worse or better. Reports some change in urination including burning, increased frequency, and feeling like he needs to go but then can't. Denies change in BM, breathing difficulty, or chest pain. Positive for some nausea and gagging with intense pain. He is worried about his gallbladder due to history of issues with his mom. PMH: gout PSH: none Allergy: NKDA, some seasonal Med: none Family: mom - gallbladder, dad - HTM and DM Social: drink socially (once per month), no tobacco/smoking, no other drug use, lives with his wife
Response: To evaluate Mr. Ryan's HPI (History of Present Illness) based on the rubric provided, we will assess the completeness and organization of the information documented.

1. **Key Information Present**: 
   - Right flank pain is mentioned, but the description of the pain is inconsistent with the answer key. The answer key specifies sharp, spasms, or colic pain, while Mr. Ryan describes a constant dull pain and intermittent sharp stabbing pain. The description of severity is also inconsistent; the answer key states 9/10, but Mr. Ryan rates his pain as 2/10 for dull pain and 10-15/10 for sharp pain.
   - The time frame is partially accurate; he states it started "a day or 2 ago," which is somewhat vague compared to the exact "24 hours" specified in the answer key.
   - Nausea is reported, but the description includes "gagging," which is not part of the answer key. The vomiting is not clearly defined as "clear or nonbloody/nonbilious."
   - Urinary symptoms are noted (burning, increased frequency), but dysuria is not clearly stated, and there is no mention of hematuria, which is a key negative finding.

2. **Conciseness and Organization**: 
   - The information is somewhat organized but includes irrelevant details (e.g., family history of gallbladder issues, which is not directly related to the symptoms).
   - The details regarding the pain and urinary symptoms are somewhat scattered and could lead to confusion about the key points.

3. **Missing Pertinent Negatives**: 
   - There are significant omissions regarding the specific qualities of pain and urinary symptoms that do not align with the answer key. There is also a lack of clarity regarding the absence of hematuria.

Overall, while some key information is present, there are many inconsistencies and omissions compared to the answer key. The history is not well organized, and the details provided obscure the key findings.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: VS - T: 99.7, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, O2: 99% room air HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, no lymphadenopathy, moist mucus membranes, normal oropharynx w/o erythema or exudate, okay dentition Chest: normal inspection, RRR, normal S1 and S2, CTAB, symmetrical lung expansion Abdomen: normal inspection, present bowel sounds, tympanic on percussion, no tenderness to light or deep palpation, - rebound tenderness, positive CVA tenderness on right side to palpation, denies left CVA tenderness to palpation or percussion Extremities: 5/5 strength bilaterally in upper and lower, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulse, no peripheral edema, normal gait
Response: The provided physical exam findings include normal vital signs, which is a key component. Additionally, the findings document positive costovertebral angle tenderness on the right side and no abdominal tenderness, which corresponds to the answer key. However, the documentation includes a lot of details about other systems (e.g., HEENT, chest, abdomen, and extremities) that, while thorough, may obscure the focus on key findings. 

There are some pertinent negatives missing; for example, the left CVA tenderness is documented as denied, but not explicitly stated in the overall summary. The organization is reasonably clear, but the extensive detail might detract from the concise reporting of the most relevant information.

Considering all these factors, the score falls between the categories of 3 and 2. Given that most key positive findings are documented but there are some omissions and the detail is somewhat excessive, I would score this section as a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 56 yo M with history of gout here for dull right sided flank pain with intermittent stabbing, pain radiates to groin, changes in urination, and not helped with OTC medications. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement based on the rubric and answer key, let's break down the essential elements:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement does not specify the onset of the pain, so this element is missing.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement mentions "right sided flank pain," which fulfills this element.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The statement describes the pain as "dull" and "intermittent stabbing," but does not indicate a specific intensity level of 10/10 or severe. This element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement mentions "intermittent stabbing," which suggests some form of spasms or waves, but it is not explicitly stated as spasms or colic. This is a gray area, but it might not fully meet the requirement.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement mentions "changes in urination," which is not listed in the optional elements. However, it does not include "non-bilious vomiting," "right groin pain," or "afebrile."

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Missing 1 essential element (acute onset).
- Missing another essential element (intensity).
- The statement is somewhat vague on spasms.
- It does not include any of the optional elements.

Based on the rubric:
- Since multiple essential elements are missing, the score would be "2" for missing multiple essential elements.

2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1 - kidney stones 2 - pyelonephritis 3 - gall stones
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we compare it to the answer key:

1. The first diagnosis, "kidney stones," matches the key (nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic) perfectly, indicating a correct interpretation of findings.
2. The second diagnosis, "pyelonephritis," also matches one of the key diagnoses (UTI/pyelonephritis), which is relevant given the symptoms likely associated with kidney stones.
3. The third diagnosis, "gall stones," is not mentioned in the answer key and does not relate to the findings associated with kidney stones or urinary tract issues.

The overall differential diagnosis includes two correct and relevant diagnoses and one irrelevant diagnosis. While the two relevant diagnoses are prioritized correctly, the inclusion of "gall stones" introduces a flaw in the overall differential.

Based on the rubric:
- The first two diagnoses are consistent with the findings.
- The third diagnosis introduces a minor flaw, but the prioritization of the first two is appropriate.

Considering these points, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, with a minor flaw due to the irrelevant diagnosis.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting

- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute

- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1 - right sided flank pain that is constant dull with intermittent stabbing pain, radiation to groin, changes in urination, CVA tender 2 - right sided flank pain, radiation to groin, CVA tenderness, not as likely due to intermittent stabbing pain that is probably due to stone obstruction, no fever or systemic infection signs 3 - some family history, unlikely due to no RUQ pain and no change with meals, would bot explain CVA tenderness
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis based on the provided information, let's analyze each point against the rubric and the answer key.

1. The first point mentions "right sided flank pain that is constant dull with intermittent stabbing pain." This does not align perfectly with the characteristics of nephrolithiasis, which is typically described as sharp, intermittent, and colicky. The mention of "radiation to groin" can support nephrolithiasis, but the description of the pain as "constant dull" is less consistent with the expected presentation.

2. The second point states "CVA tenderness," which is indeed relevant for both UTI/pyelonephritis and possibly nephrolithiasis. However, the statement "not as likely due to intermittent stabbing pain that is probably due to stone obstruction" suggests a lack of clarity in linking the symptoms to the correct diagnosis, particularly if the pain is described as dull initially.

3. The third point discusses family history and states "unlikely due to no RUQ pain and no change with meals." This point does not directly correlate with the differential diagnoses provided, as RUQ pain is not a typical presenting symptom for nephrolithiasis or UTI/pyelonephritis, but the reasoning does not strongly support any diagnosis.

Overall, while there are some elements that touch on the correct diagnoses, the support provided lacks accurate and complete links to the findings, particularly with the descriptions of pain and the reasoning for excluding certain diagnoses. The connections made are weak and contain inaccuracies.

Based on this analysis, I would assign a score of 2 for weakly supported differential diagnosis with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CT scan of abdomen, urinalysis, CBC for WBC
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, let's break down the components based on the rubric:

1. **Required Tests**: The required test, a urinalysis (UA), is included in the plan.
2. **Acceptable Tests**: The plan includes a CT scan of the abdomen, which is acceptable, but it is not listed as essential. The CBC for WBC is not mentioned in the answer key as either acceptable or required. 
3. **Unacceptable Tests**: There are no unacceptable tests included in the plan.

Now, let's assess the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the plan:

- The urinalysis is essential and included.
- The CT scan is acceptable but may not be necessary depending on the context of the symptoms.
- The CBC for WBC is not listed in the answer key and may be considered an unnecessary test.

Given that the plan includes the essential urinalysis and one acceptable test (CT scan), but also includes a test (CBC) that is not mentioned as necessary or acceptable, it reflects a reasonable plan with some unnecessary tests.

Thus, the plan does not fully align with the criteria for an effective and efficient workup, as it includes unnecessary tests and could be improved by focusing more on essential tests.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 3, as it is a reasonable plan but includes some unnecessary tests.

Reports some change in urination including burning, increased frequency, and feeling like he needs to go but then can't. Denies change in BM, breathing difficulty, or chest pain. Positive for some nausea and gagging with intense pain. He is worried about his gallbladder due to history of issues with his mom. PMH: gout PSH: none Allergy: NKDA, some seasonal Med: none Family: mom - gallbladder, dad - HTM and DM Social: drink socially (once per month), no tobacco/smoking, no other drug use, lives with his wife

Physical Examination:
VS - T: 99.7, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, O2: 99% room air HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, no lymphadenopathy, moist mucus membranes, normal oropharynx w/o erythema or exudate, okay dentition Chest: normal inspection, RRR, normal S1 and S2, CTAB, symmetrical lung expansion Abdomen: normal inspection, present bowel sounds, tympanic on percussion, no tenderness to light or deep palpation, - rebound tenderness, positive CVA tenderness on right side to palpation, denies left CVA tenderness to palpation or percussion Extremities: 5/5 strength bilaterally in upper and lower, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulse, no peripheral edema, normal gait

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a 56 yo M with history of gout here for dull right sided flank pain with intermittent stabbing, pain radiates to groin, changes in urination, and not helped with OTC medications. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1 - kidney stones 2 - pyelonephritis 3 - gall stones

Supporting Information:
1 - right sided flank pain that is constant dull with intermittent stabbing pain, radiation to groin, changes in urination, CVA tender 2 - right sided flank pain, radiation to groin, CVA tenderness, not as likely due to intermittent stabbing pain that is probably due to stone obstruction, no fever or systemic infection signs 3 - some family history, unlikely due to no RUQ pain and no change with meals, would bot explain CVA tenderness

Plan:
CT scan of abdomen, urinalysis, CBC for WBC

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI Nathaniel Ryan is a 56 yo male who presents to the ED due to right flank pain that started accutely 24 hours ago.Mr. Ryan states that the pain is sharp and radiates from his right flank to his right groin. He says the pain waxes and wanes and he has difficulty getting comfortable. He has also experienced an episode of nausea and vomiting once the pain in his flank began. He has also noticed that for the past 24 hours, he has experienced some pain with urinating. He has not been able to identify anything that makes the pain better or worse, but believes it is progressively worsening. ROS Const: Denies any fevers or changes in appetite HEENT: Denies any sinus congestion or headaches Pulm: Denies any cough or SOB Cardio: Denies chest pain or palpitations GI: Denies any changes in bowel habits GU: As stated above. Denies any hematuria MSK: Denies any joint pain or muscle soreness Skin: Denies any skin rashes or lesions Neuro: Denies any weakness or sensory changes. Past medical history -Had an episode of gout 2 years ago Meds/Allergies -No current medications or known allergies Family History -Mother has a history of cholecystitis with removal of her gallbladder -Father has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension Surgical Hx -None Social Hx -Denies any tobacco use, endorses drinking a couple beers a month, and denies substance abuse.
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI (History of Present Illness) for Nathaniel Ryan against the rubric, we can identify the following points:

1. **Right flank pain**: The HPI correctly identifies right flank pain as the primary concern.
2. **Duration**: The note states that the pain started acutely 24 hours ago, which is accurate.
3. **Quality of pain**: The pain is described as sharp, which matches the answer key.
4. **Character of pain**: The note mentions that the pain waxes and wanes, which somewhat describes the spasms or colic every 1-2 hours but does not explicitly state this pattern.
5. **Severity**: The severity of the pain is not quantified (e.g., does not mention 9/10), which is a key omission.
6. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are mentioned, and it is specified that the vomiting is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious, but this detail is not included in the HPI.
7. **Dysuria and urgency**: The note mentions pain with urination but does not specifically state urgency.
8. **Hematuria**: The patient denies hematuria, which is accurately noted.

Overall, while the HPI contains several key pieces of information, it is missing some critical details such as the severity of pain and the specific pattern of spasms or colic. The organization is generally clear, but the lack of explicit details regarding severity and the character of the pain impacts the overall completeness.

Given these observations, I would score this HPI as a 2, as it has omitted many key historical findings and is somewhat disorganized in conveying the critical elements.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Temp: 99.7 HR 85 RR16 BP 128/82 O2 99% on RA General: Sitting on exam table. Appears stated age. No acute distress. HEENT: Head normocephalic and atraumatic. Pupils equal and reactive to light bilaterally. Extraoccular movements intact bilaterally. Moist mucus membranes. Dentition appears normal. No oral ulcerations or lesions. Pulm: Lungs clear to auscultation bilterally Cardio: No JVD, No carotid bruits. Regular rate and rhythm. Radial pulses intact bilterally. Dorsalis pedis pulses intact bilaterally. No peripheral edema. GI: Abdomen appears soft and nondistended. Bowel sounds ausculted in all quadrants. Abdomen is tender to palpation in the RLQ and and R groin area. There is also some tenderness to palpation at the right flank and there is some right costovertebral tenderness present GU: Defered MSK: Full range of potion. No joint tenderness. Skin: Skin appears clean and dry. No lesions. Neuro: Gait is normal. Cranial nerves crossly intact. No sensory deficits in upper or lower extremities bilaterally. 5/5 upper and lower extremity strength bilaterally.
Response: In evaluating the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we note the following:

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are documented, but the temperature is slightly elevated (99.7°F), which may not be considered "normal." This could be seen as a key finding.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: This finding is present and documented.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note states that the abdomen is tender to palpation in the RLQ, R groin area, and right flank, which contradicts the requirement of no abdominal tenderness.

The organization of the physical exam findings is mostly clear and follows a systematic approach, but the presence of key omissions (normal vitals, and specifically abdominal tenderness) affects the score. The exam includes extensive details, which might obscure the key findings.

Given these points, the physical exam findings are missing some key aspects and include some disorganization due to conflicting information regarding abdominal tenderness.

Based on the rubric, this would likely fall under a score of 2, as many key findings are omitted or not accurately documented.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 56 yo male who presents to the ED due to acute onset, "sharp," waxing and waning, r flank pain that radiates to the right groin associated with nausea, vomiting, and pain with urination.
Response: Let's evaluate the provided statement against the rubric and the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - Present: "acute onset"
2. **Right flank pain** - Present: "r flank pain"
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - Not explicitly stated, as "sharp" does not quantify the intensity to 10/10 or severe.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - Present: "waxing and waning" indicates that the pain comes in waves.
5. **Optional elements** - "nausea" and "vomiting" are mentioned, but they are not part of the required elements.

Now, let's count the elements:
- Total elements present: 4 essential elements and 2 optional elements.

According to the rubric:
- The statement is missing 1 essential element (the intensity of the pain).
- The total number of elements is 6, which is more than 5.

Based on this evaluation, the score would be a 3 since it is missing 1 essential element and has more than 5 total elements.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Acute Cholecystitis
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided:

1. Nephrolithiasis - This is consistent with the findings as it aligns with common symptoms such as flank pain, hematuria, and possibly urinary symptoms.
2. Pyelonephritis - This is also appropriate given that it can present with similar symptoms, especially if there are signs of infection or systemic symptoms.
3. Acute Cholecystitis - This diagnosis is less relevant in this context, as it typically presents with right upper quadrant pain, fever, and possibly jaundice, which do not align with kidney-related symptoms.

Overall, the first two diagnoses are pertinent and prioritized correctly, but the inclusion of acute cholecystitis introduces an inaccurate element to the differential diagnosis. The prioritization of the first two is strong, but the presence of an unrelated diagnosis affects the overall consistency.

Thus, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings, but the inclusion of an irrelevant diagnosis slightly detracts from the overall accuracy.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Given the acute onset and waxing and waning nature of the pain that is located at the right flank that radiates to the right groin associated with pain with urination a kidney stone is most likely. The patient also has a history of gout that is not controlled on any medications which places him at higher risk. 2. Given his pain in the right flank and costovertebral tenderness on exam, he may been experiencing pyelonrphtitis; however, he is afebrile and is not experiencing any other symptoms other than pain radiating to the groin. 3. Acute cholecystitis is possible given his family history with possible referred pain to the right flank; however, he is not experiencing in RUQ tenderness on examination, he is afebrile, and there is no previous history of episodes like this and there is no connection with the patients diet.
Response: The provided differential diagnosis evaluation includes the following points:

1. **Kidney Stone (Nephrolithiasis/Renal Colic)**: The student correctly identifies this as the most likely diagnosis based on the acute onset, waxing and waning nature of the pain, its location, and the history of gout. This is a strong connection supported by the patient's symptoms and medical history.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: The student mentions pyelonephritis as a possibility due to flank pain and costovertebral tenderness. However, the absence of fever and additional symptoms weakens this link. While the differential is appropriate, the reasoning lacks the necessary support, which could impact patient care.

3. **Acute Cholecystitis**: The student identifies acute cholecystitis as a possible diagnosis but correctly notes the lack of supporting symptoms (RUQ tenderness, afebrile status, and no dietary connections). This consideration is reasonable but not strongly linked to the presented symptoms.

Overall, the student provides a differential diagnosis that is mostly appropriate and supported, but there are some missing links and weaknesses in the reasoning for pyelonephritis and acute cholecystitis. The connections made for kidney stones are strong, while the others are less so.

Given this evaluation, I would score this section as a 3.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score:  -@Plan to get A urinalysis and CMP to assess kidney function -Pending results on UA and CMP, Plan to get A renal ultrasound and CT abdomen/@pelvis to assess for possible stone or pyelonephritis. Imaging could also indicate if there is any blockage. -Depending on results of UA and Imaging, consider A RUQ/Gallbladder ultrasound to assess for any bile duct dilation, any gallstones, or Gallbladder wall thickening.
Response: The plan provided includes a urinalysis (UA), which is essential. It also mentions a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), which is acceptable for assessing kidney function, but it is not explicitly listed as required. The plan includes a renal ultrasound and a CT abdomen/pelvis, both of which are acceptable for further evaluation of possible stones or pyelonephritis. However, it also suggests a RUQ/Gallbladder ultrasound based on the results of the UA and imaging, which introduces unnecessary tests that are not directly related to the initial symptoms described.

Overall, the plan includes all essential tests but also includes some unnecessary tests (the RUQ/Gallbladder ultrasound) and relies on additional imaging that may not be directly warranted based on the initial presentation. Therefore, while it is a reasonable plan, it includes some unnecessary elements.

Based on the rubric, this plan falls under the category of a "reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests."

Summary:
Nathaniel Ryan is a 56 yo male who presents to the ED due to acute onset, "sharp," waxing and waning, r flank pain that radiates to the right groin associated with nausea, vomiting, and pain with urination.

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Acute Cholecystitis

Supporting Information:
1. Given the acute onset and waxing and waning nature of the pain that is located at the right flank that radiates to the right groin associated with pain with urination a kidney stone is most likely. The patient also has a history of gout that is not controlled on any medications which places him at higher risk. 2.

Response: The organization of the provided note is quite comprehensive and follows a clear structure, with distinct sections for History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section is appropriately labeled and contains relevant information, which contributes to the overall clarity of the note. 

However, there are a few minor issues that affect the score:
1. There are some typographical errors (e.g., "accute" should be "acute", "bilterally" should be "bilaterally", "Defered" should be "Deferred", "pyelonrphtitis" should be "pyelonephritis").
2. The organization of the physical examination could be improved slightly by ensuring consistency in how findings are presented (e.g., some sections include "Denies" while others do not).

Despite these minor issues, the overall organization is intact, and the information is presented clearly in appropriate sections without significant omissions or repetition.

Given this evaluation, I would score the organization as follows:

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Nathaniel "Nathan" Ryan is a middle-aged male who presents to the ED with right flank pain. Pain started suddenly yesterday. The pain is located in his right flank and radiates down to his groin. He has taken tylenol without relief. Moving around seems to improve the pain. The pain is a 2 or 3/10 at baseline but occasionally worsens. At one point the pain became so intense he considered calling an ambulance to bring him to the ED. He does have associated nausea and urinary urgency. He denies any hematuria. ROS: No fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria, joint pain. Otherwise as reported in HPI. PMHx: Gout, not currently taking medication. Poor dentition, sees dentist and is scheduled for dental work soon. PSHx: None Allergies: None Social Hx: Never smoked. Occasional alcohol use. Sexually active with only his wife. 
Response: In evaluating the HPI provided for Mr. Nathaniel Ryan against the rubric, we can see that some key components are addressed while others are missing or inadequately documented.

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does present with right flank pain, which is good.
2. **Duration**: The pain is stated to have started "suddenly yesterday," which indicates a duration of approximately 24 hours. This aligns with the rubric's requirement for acute pain.
3. **Description of pain**: The pain is described as a 2 or 3/10 at baseline but can worsen to a level that he considered an ambulance. However, the description of the pain as "sharp" and the presence of "spasms" or "colic" every 1-2 hours are not mentioned.
4. **Severity**: The highest reported severity is 3/10, which does not meet the rubric's requirement of severe pain (9/10).
5. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea is mentioned, but the vomiting is not clearly documented as "clear or nonbloody/nonbilious." Urinary urgency is acknowledged, but there is no mention of dysuria.
6. **Hematuria**: The patient denies hematuria, which is documented correctly.

Overall, while the note includes some key information, it misses several critical details such as the exact description of the pain, the severity of the pain, and the specifics regarding nausea and urinary symptoms. The organization is fairly coherent, but the absence of several key historical findings suggests a lower score.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 2.

Non-tender to light and deep palpation in epigastric, RUQ, LUQ, RLQ, LLQ, or suprapubic region. No palpable hernias. Negative Murphy sign. Negative Rovsing sign. No rebound tenderness. Neuro: Normal gait. EOM intact. Direct and indirect pupillary light reflex intact. Accommodation intact. Upper and lower extremity strength 5/5. 
Response: In evaluating the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we can identify the following:

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are documented and include temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. This aligns with the requirement for normal vitals.
   
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The note states "Right CVA tenderness," which indicates a positive finding in this area. 

3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note documents "Non-tender to light and deep palpation" in all quadrants, which addresses the requirement for no abdominal tenderness.

Overall, the findings are mostly well organized, with relevant information included. However, there are some additional findings that could be considered pertinent negatives that are not explicitly mentioned, such as the absence of specific neurological deficits or signs of acute distress beyond the noted discomfort.

Given that almost all key findings are present and organized well, but with some missing pertinent negatives, the score would fall in the "3" category.

I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle-aged male with a history of gout who presents with a 1 day history of right flank pain. Patient's only medical history is gout. He complains of right flank pain that radiates to his groin with associated nausea and urinary urgency. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements from the answer key that are present:

1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours: Present (1 day history)
2. Right flank pain: Present
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity: Not explicitly stated (the intensity is not rated)
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves: Not mentioned
5. Optional elements: Nausea is mentioned, but not the others (non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, afebrile).

Now, let's assess the summary:

- The summary contains the essential elements 1 and 2 but is missing essential elements 3 and 4. 
- The summary includes additional detail (nausea and urinary urgency), but overall, it does not meet the criteria for the maximum score due to missing multiple essential elements.

Based on the rubric:
- The summary has 2 essential elements present and is missing 2 essential elements.

Therefore, the score for this section is 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Kidney infection 3. Strained paraspinal muscle
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis presented, we need to consider how well it aligns with the findings and the prioritization of the conditions.

1. **Nephrolithiasis (Kidney Stone/Renal Colic)**: This is a correct and relevant diagnosis given the common presentation of severe flank pain, which is a classic symptom of kidney stones. It is appropriate to prioritize this condition first.

2. **Kidney Infection (UTI/Pyelonephritis)**: This is also a relevant diagnosis, as it can present with similar symptoms to kidney stones, such as flank pain and possibly fever or dysuria. However, it is slightly less prioritized than nephrolithiasis in typical presentations unless there are specific signs of infection.

3. **Strained Paraspinal Muscle**: While this is an optional diagnosis, it is less consistent with the typical presenting symptoms of renal colic or a kidney infection. It may not be as relevant in the context of the other two diagnoses.

Overall, the differential diagnosis shows a strong understanding of the pertinent conditions related to the symptoms, with nephrolithiasis being correctly prioritized. However, the second diagnosis (kidney infection) is a bit less prioritized than it could be, and the third diagnosis (muscle strain) is less relevant in this context.

Based on the rubric:
- The first two diagnoses are consistent with findings and appropriately prioritized, but the third is less relevant.
- There is a minor flaw in prioritization, but it does not negatively impact patient care significantly.

Thus, I would score this differential diagnosis as a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis: sudden onset of pain 1 day ago with waxing and waning nature. Associated nausea and urinary urgency. Rocking back and forth during exam due to pain. Right CVA tenderness. History of gout. 2. Kidney infection: Right CVA tenderness with pain that radiates to groin with some associated urinary urgency. Elevated temperature of 99.7 during visit. 3. Strained paraspinal muscle: Patient admits that he went to the gym recently for the first time in a long time. 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to analyze how well the student has linked their findings to the potential diagnoses based on the information given in the answer key.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The student mentions "sudden onset of pain 1 day ago with waxing and waning nature," which is consistent with renal colic. The associated nausea and urinary urgency are also relevant findings. The mention of "rocking back and forth during exam due to pain" indicates the severity of the pain, which is appropriate. Additionally, "right CVA tenderness" supports this diagnosis, and the history of gout is a relevant risk factor. Overall, this section is well-supported and links correctly to the diagnosis.

2. **Kidney infection (UTI/Pyelonephritis)**: The student notes "Right CVA tenderness with pain that radiates to groin with some associated urinary urgency." The right CVA tenderness is a key finding for pyelonephritis, and the urinary urgency is relevant. However, the absence of dysuria or urgency could be seen as a missing link. The elevated temperature of 99.7 is a relevant finding that could indicate infection. While there are some strong points, the missing elements (like dysuria) and the fact that some links could be stronger detracts slightly from the overall support.

3. **Strained paraspinal muscle**: The student mentions that the patient "went to the gym recently for the first time in a long time," which is relevant to the muscle strain diagnosis. However, the linkage could be stronger if there were more details about the nature of the pain or any specific muscle strain symptoms (like pain on movement). 

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported, but there are some missing links and slight inaccuracies, particularly in the second diagnosis. This would not negatively impact patient care significantly, as the major concerns are still addressed.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 3 for the differential diagnosis.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score:  -@ pain medication to control pain -@ CT abdomen to identify possible stone -@ UA to analyze urine for hematuria or UTI/@kidney infection -@ CBC and BMP for WBC and kidney function -@ Urology consult if stone is confirmed and is too large to pass
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we need to assess it against the rubric criteria.

1. **Required Tests**: The plan includes a Urinalysis (UA), which is required.
2. **Acceptable Tests**: The plan includes a CT abdomen, BMP, and CBC, which are acceptable tests.
3. **Unacceptable Tests**: There are no unacceptable tests listed in the plan.

Now, considering the effectiveness and efficiency of the plan:
- The UA is essential and included.
- The CT abdomen is reasonable to check for stones.
- The BMP is acceptable for assessing kidney function.
- The CBC is acceptable for checking WBC count, which can help in evaluating infection.
- The plan does not include any unnecessary tests.

Overall, the plan is reasonable and includes all essential tests without unnecessary ones, aligning with the criteria for a score of 4.

Plan:
 -@ pain medication to control pain -@ CT abdomen to identify possible stone -@ UA to analyze urine for hematuria or UTI/@kidney infection -@ CBC and BMP for WBC and kidney function -@ Urology consult if stone is confirmed and is too large to pass


Response: The organization of the provided note is quite structured and follows the appropriate sections as outlined in the rubric. The History of Present Illness (HPI) is clearly defined, detailing the patient's symptoms and relevant history. The Review of Systems (ROS), Past Medical History (PMHx), Past Surgical History (PSHx), Allergies, and Social History (Social Hx) are all clearly separated and presented in a logical manner.

The Physical Examination section is well-organized, with findings clearly categorized by body system, making it easy to follow. The Summary succinctly encapsulates the key points from the HPI and PMHx. The Differential Diagnosis is numbered and clearly presented, with supporting information that is relevant to each diagnosis. The Plan section is also organized, utilizing bullet points to list the interventions clearly.

Given that all features are organized with information presented in appropriate sections, I would assign a score of 4.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI: Nathaniel Ryan is a 57 year old male presenting to the ED for right-sided flank pain. Patient reports 24 hour history of occasional, severe pain in right flank. He says approximately every 30 minutes, he will experience 9/10 sharp spasm pain in his right back that will occasional radiate around front into his groin. He says he started working out 1 week ago, and last worked out on the rowing machine 2 days ago. Patient has never had similar pain before. He has tried tylenol and ibuprofen and home with no relief; he has not tried heat, ice, stretching, etc. Last night, he experienced nausea and 2 episodes of vomiting due to the pain; these symptoms resolved after the pain went away. Patient also reports 2 day history of burning pee but denies blood in urine; patient has never experienced this before. Patient has no history of kidney stones or UTIs. Patient shares he thought it was potentially a strained muscle from working out. He also considered his gallbladder due to his mother's history, and would like to confirm it is not his gallbladder. ROS - negative except for HPI PMH - none PSH - appendectomy as child Meds - none Allergies - none FH - mother = gallstones s/p cholecystectomy; father = DM, HTN
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI against the rubric, we can identify the following aspects:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does report right-sided flank pain, which is a key component.
2. **Duration**: The patient mentions a 24-hour history of pain, which is included correctly.
3. **Characteristics of pain**: The description of the pain as "sharp" and "severe" (9/10) is present, but the mention of spasms or colic is not clearly stated. Instead, the patient describes pain occurring every 30 minutes, which does not directly align with the "spasms OR colic every 1-2 hours" requirement.
4. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient reports nausea and vomiting, which is documented as clear or nonbloody/nonbilious; however, it states that these symptoms resolved after the pain went away, which is somewhat relevant but does not specify if the vomiting was clear or nonbloody.
5. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient mentions a 2-day history of burning during urination and denies hematuria, which is documented correctly. However, urgency is not specifically mentioned.
6. **Overall organization**: The HPI is generally organized but could be clearer in separating key pieces of information. There are some extraneous details about the patient's workout history and family history that could be considered irrelevant to the HPI.

Based on this analysis, the HPI contains most of the key information but misses some pertinent negatives (specifically, the detail about spasms and urgency). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a score of 4, but it does provide a substantial amount of relevant information.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: T - 99.7 HR - 85 RR - 16 BP - 128/82 O2 - 99% on room air General: A&O x3, pleasant HEENT: PERRLA, normal EOM Cardiac: RRR, S1 + S2, no gallop/murmur, 1+ pitting edema bilateral LE Respiratory: chest normal to inspection, CTAB Abdominal: normal to inspection, normal bowel sounds, mild right-sided tenderness (RUQ + RLQ), (-) Murphy sign, (-) suprapubic tenderness, (+) right CVA tenderness, (+) right-sided rebound tenderness MSK: 5/5 strength bilateral UE + LE, no spinal tenderness to palpation, no paravertebral tenderness to palpation 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we will assess the presence and organization of key findings as well as any missing pertinent negatives.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vitals are documented as normal, which is a positive aspect.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: This is noted as positive, which aligns with the answer key.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The note indicates "mild right-sided tenderness" and "positive right-sided rebound tenderness," which contradicts the answer key's requirement for no abdominal tenderness.

Now, let's analyze the organization:
- The physical exam findings are mostly well organized by system (General, HEENT, Cardiac, Respiratory, Abdominal, MSK).
- However, the presence of multiple tenderness findings in the abdominal section (mild right-sided tenderness and positive rebound tenderness) indicates that key findings are not accurately documented as per the answer key, which specifies no abdominal tenderness.

Considering these points:
- The note includes normal vitals and positive CVA tenderness, but it fails to meet the requirement of no abdominal tenderness and includes additional findings that could confuse the key points.
- The organization is generally good, but the inaccuracies in the abdominal findings detract from the overall quality.

Based on the rubric:
- The note is missing key physical exam findings (specifically the absence of abdominal tenderness) and contains inaccuracies regarding abdominal findings. Thus, it cannot score above a 2.

Final score: 2

2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 57 year old male presenting to the ED for 24 hour history of severe occasional right flank pain and 2 day history of dysuria. Patient has right CVA tenderness and right rebound tenderness.
Response: To evaluate the provided note against the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements from the answer key that are present in the statement.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - The note states a "24 hour history," which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain** - The note mentions "right flank pain," which is included.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - The note states "severe occasional right flank pain," which meets the requirement for severe intensity.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - The note does not mention spasms, colic, or that the pain comes in waves; it only mentions "occasional" pain.
5. **Optional elements** - The note includes a mention of dysuria, which is not one of the optional elements listed in the answer key.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- All essential elements except one are present (missing the element regarding spasms/colic/wave-like pain).
- The statement contains a total of 4 identifiable elements (the 4 essential elements that are present), which is fewer than 5.

According to the rubric:
- Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements corresponds to a score of 3.

Therefore, the score for this section is:

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1) Nephrolithiasis 2) UTI 3) Lumbosacral strain
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided (1) Nephrolithiasis, (2) UTI, and (3) Lumbosacral strain, we can compare it to the answer key.

1. **Nephrolithiasis** is correctly identified and is the most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms typically associated with kidney stones.
2. **UTI** is also a relevant differential and aligns with potential urinary symptoms.
3. **Lumbosacral strain** is not in the answer key and may be a less likely cause of the symptoms described compared to the other two options. However, it is a reasonable consideration for back pain.

Overall, the differential diagnosis presented is generally consistent with the findings. There is a minor flaw in prioritization since the lumbosacral strain is not as relevant as the optional diagnoses (muscle strain and inguinal hernia), but it does not significantly detract from patient care.

Considering these points, I would score this differential diagnosis as a 3 based on the rubric.

1) **Nephrolithiasis**: The student identifies right flank pain and relates it to the exam findings, including costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness, which is appropriate. However, they mention dysuria and rebound tenderness, which are not typically associated with nephrolithiasis but rather with a UTI or pyelonephritis. The mention of severe cyclical flank pain is relevant, but the expectation of hematuria is not clearly linked in the findings presented. Overall, while there are some correct elements, there are inaccuracies in linking the findings to nephrolithiasis.

2) **UTI**: The student correctly supports UTI with the history of dysuria and mentions CVA tenderness. However, they note that suprapubic tenderness and higher fever would be expected, which are relevant but not specifically linked to the patient's symptoms as presented. The support is appropriate but incomplete.

3) **Lumbosacral strain**: The student correctly connects the recent exercise to the muscle strain, but they acknowledge that it does not correlate with dysuria or abdominal exam findings. This recognition shows a good understanding of the differential diagnosis.

Overall, while the student demonstrates an understanding of the differential diagnoses and provides some appropriate links, there are inaccuracies and incomplete connections that affect the overall quality of the differential diagnosis. Therefore, the score reflects that there are several incorrect links and missing elements that could negatively impact patient care.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1) Nephrolithiasis - get UA, assess for hematuria. Obtain abdominal ultrasound, specifically to assess for kidney stones on right side. Also obtain RUQ ultrasound to check for gallstones per patient request. Patient would also benefit from abdominal CT for clearer picture of stones. In the mean time, offer stronger pain reliever and tylenol for fever. 2) UTI - get UA and urine culture. Offer adequate pain and fever control. Offer zofran for return of nausea. 3) Lumbosacral strain - recommend rest from exercise, provide adequate pain relief and potentially a muscle relaxer. Recommend heat/ice therapy. 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup against the rubric, we need to assess the included tests and their relevance to the differential diagnoses.

1) **Nephrolithiasis** - The plan includes a UA, which is essential, and an abdominal ultrasound. The abdominal ultrasound is acceptable for assessing kidney stones. However, the RUQ ultrasound to check for gallstones is unnecessary for the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis and adds to the workload without clear relevance. The abdominal CT is acceptable, but it may not be necessary if the ultrasound is sufficient. Overall, this part of the plan includes essential tests but also includes unnecessary tests.

2) **UTI** - The plan includes a UA and urine culture, which are essential for diagnosing a UTI. The plan for pain and fever control is reasonable and relevant. This part of the plan effectively captures the necessary workup.

3) **Lumbosacral strain** - This section does not include any diagnostic tests, which may be acceptable for a strain, as it is often a clinical diagnosis. However, it lacks any further workup or imaging that could be considered if the symptoms were severe or persistent.

Overall, the plan includes some essential tests, but it also includes unnecessary tests (RUQ ultrasound for gallstones) and misses a more thorough approach for the lumbosacral strain. Given these factors, I would rate the plan as a reasonable plan but with some unnecessary tests included.

1) Most features are disorganized, with appropriate sections missing.. Here is the answer key for org: . Please evaluate the following org and provide a score: History of Present Illness:
HPI: Nathaniel Ryan is a 57 year old male presenting to the ED for right-sided flank pain. Patient reports 24 hour history of occasional, severe pain in right flank. He says approximately every 30 minutes, he will experience 9/10 sharp spasm pain in his right back that will occasional radiate around front into his groin. He says he started working out 1 week ago, and last worked out on the rowing machine 2 days ago. Patient has never had similar pain before. He has tried tylenol and ibuprofen and home with no relief; he has not tried heat, ice, stretching, etc. Last night, he experienced nausea and 2 episodes of vomiting due to the pain; these symptoms resolved after the pain went away. Patient also reports 2 day history of burning pee but denies blood in urine; patient has never experienced this before. Patient has no history of kidney stones or UTIs. Patient shares he thought it was potentially a strained muscle from working out. He also considered his gallbladder due to his mother's history, and would like to confirm it is not his gallbladder. ROS - negative except for HPI PMH - none PSH - appendectomy as child Meds - none Allergies - none FH - mother = gallstones s/p cholecystectomy; father = DM, HTN

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 57 yo male with PMH significant for gout. He has had 24 hours of intermittent right flank pain that radiates to the right groin. He reports the pain is a 9/10, sharp, and comes about every 30 minutes. Ibprophen and tylenol have not helped to resolve the pain. The pain has caused emesis on multiple occasions. He has no prior history of kidney stones and has had no previous illness like this. He denies fever or chills. He has had dysuria without hematuria. FH: Mother had gall stones, dad has diabetes Social: Drinks mostly coke, beer on weekends, nonsmoker, recently started working out frequently Allergies: None Medications: none ROS General: No fever, chills, malease Resp: Denies SOB, cough, labored breathing Cards: Denies chest pain or palpitaions GI: No abdominla pain, no changes in stool GU: Right sided flank pain, dysuria, no hematuria Neuro: No defecits noted
Response: In evaluating the provided history of present illness (HPI) for Mr. Ryan against the rubric, we can break down the key elements as follows:

1. **Right flank pain**: Present, described as intermittent, sharp, and rated 9/10. However, the frequency of the pain is reported as every 30 minutes instead of every 1-2 hours as per the answer key.
2. **Duration**: Correctly noted as lasting for 24 hours.
3. **Severity**: Correctly rated as severe (9/10).
4. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are mentioned, but the description of the emesis is vague (it states "the pain has caused emesis on multiple occasions" but does not specify if it was clear or nonbloody/nonbilious).
5. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: Dysuria is noted, but urgency is not explicitly mentioned. Hematuria is correctly denied.

While most key historical findings are present, there are some omissions and disorganization in the details, particularly regarding the frequency of pain and the description of vomiting. The patient’s family and social history, as well as the review of systems (ROS), provide additional context but are not central to the HPI scoring.

Overall, the HPI includes a good amount of relevant information but misses some key details and has minor inconsistencies.

Based on the rubric criteria, I would score this HPI as follows:
- Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, but it is missing some pertinent negatives (e.g., details about vomiting and urgency).

Thus, the score would be a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: General: No acute distress, sitting comfortably on table HEENT: Pupils react to light bilaterally, ocular movement intact, no cervical lymph nodes Resp: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no cough, no tachpenea Card: Audible S1 and S2, no murmurs Abdomin: Soft, non distended, pain to palpation of LLQ but otherwise unremarkale, murphy negative GU: Psoas sign negative, right sided costovertebral ange tenderness MSK: Bilateral lower extremity edema, no paraspinal pain Neuro: No deficits noted 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings based on the answer key, we need to identify the presence of key findings and their organization.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The note does not explicitly mention vital signs, which is a significant omission.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The note mentions "right sided costovertebral angle tenderness," which aligns with the key finding.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note states "pain to palpation of LLQ but otherwise unremarkable," which contradicts the key finding of "no abdominal tenderness."

Now, let's analyze the organization and conciseness. The findings are detailed and cover multiple systems, but the presence of details that are not relevant to the key findings (like the extensive detail in the abdominal exam) may obscure the key points.

Based on the rubric:
- The absence of normal vitals and the misrepresentation of abdominal tenderness are significant issues.
- While there are some key findings documented, the organization could be improved, and there are missing pertinent negatives.

Given these considerations, I would assign a score of 2, as many key physical exam findings are omitted, and the exam is somewhat disorganized.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: 57 yo male with history of gout with one day history of intermittent right flank pain, radiation to groin, dysuria, no hematuria, and no fever or chills.
Response: Let's analyze the provided statement based on the rubric and the answer key.

The essential elements from the answer key are:
1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2. Right flank pain
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional: Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile

Now, let's break down the statement:

- "57 yo male with history of gout with one day history of intermittent right flank pain" 
  - This includes "Acute onset OR past 24 hours" (1) and "Right flank pain" (2).
  
- "radiation to groin" 
  - This indicates radiation of pain but does not specifically mention "Right groin pain" from the optional list. However, it does suggest some aspect of the optional element.

- "dysuria, no hematuria, and no fever or chills" 
  - There is no mention of pain intensity or spasms/colic.

Now, let's evaluate the essential elements:
1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours - Present
2. Right flank pain - Present
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity - Missing
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves - Missing

The student has included two essential elements but is missing two, which means they are missing multiple essential elements.

According to the rubric:
- Missing multiple essential elements corresponds to a score of 2.

Final score: 2

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: Kidney Stone (uric acid) Kidney stone (other etiology) Pyelonephritis
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided (Kidney Stone (uric acid), Kidney stone (other etiology), Pyelonephritis), we need to analyze how well it aligns with the key points in the rubric.

1. **Kidney Stone (uric acid)** - This is a specific type of nephrolithiasis, which is correct. However, it should be noted that the answer key did not specify uric acid stones as the primary differential, which could be seen as a minor flaw in specificity.

2. **Kidney stone (other etiology)** - This aligns with nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic from the answer key, but it does not prioritize the specific types of stones which could be relevant in a clinical context. 

3. **Pyelonephritis** - This is consistent with the answer key's UTI/pyelonephritis, which is appropriate given the symptoms that may overlap with kidney stones.

The overall prioritization of the differential diagnosis is reasonable, but it does show some flaws. The use of “kidney stone (uric acid)” and “kidney stone (other etiology)” could be seen as overly broad since they do not clearly differentiate between the types of kidney stones, which could affect clinical decision-making. However, the inclusion of pyelonephritis is appropriate.

Based on this analysis, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, but it has minor flaws in prioritization. Therefore, I would score this section as a 3.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: Kidney stone: Unilateral flank pain that is intermitent, no fveer or chills,diet and drinking habits support Pyelonephritis: Right constovertebral angle tenderness, pain that wraps around the right abdomen and into groin, however, no fevr or chills and not sick appearing make this less likely
Response: To evaluate the provided differential diagnosis, we need to analyze how well the student's reasoning aligns with the expected links to the diagnoses based on the answer key.

1. **Kidney Stone (Nephrolithiasis/Renal Colic)**:
   - The student mentions "unilateral flank pain that is intermittent," which aligns with the key points for kidney stones. However, they do not mention the severity of the pain or any associated symptoms like nausea and vomiting, which are relevant to support this diagnosis fully. The absence of fever or chills is noted, which is consistent with kidney stones but does not strengthen this diagnosis since those symptoms are not typically expected with kidney stones.

2. **Pyelonephritis (UTI/Pyelonephritis)**:
   - The student identifies "right costovertebral angle tenderness" and "pain that wraps around the right abdomen and into the groin," which are relevant symptoms. However, the absence of fever or chills and the note that the patient does not appear sick weaken the support for this diagnosis. The student correctly identifies that these findings make pyelonephritis less likely, which is a reasonable conclusion.

3. **Overall Assessment**:
   - The differential diagnosis for kidney stones is partially supported but lacks some critical details. For pyelonephritis, while some relevant symptoms are mentioned, the overall assessment indicates that it is less likely due to the absence of significant accompanying symptoms.
   - The student has provided a differential diagnosis that is somewhat supported but contains gaps that could impact patient care. The links to the diagnoses are not entirely complete or accurate.

Based on the provided rubric:
- The differential diagnosis is appropriately supported but has missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care, as the student has correctly identified the likelihood of each condition.

Therefore, I would assign a score of 3.

2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Ultrasound both kidneys UA to check for infection, blood, and sediment CT to assess for stones bilaterally Multi modal pain control including torodol and hydrocodone and allow patient to pass at home if small Surgical intervention if necessary 
Response: The provided plan includes the following components:

1. **Ultrasound both kidneys**: This is an acceptable test as per the rubric.
2. **UA to check for infection, blood, and sediment**: This is a required test and is included.
3. **CT to assess for stones bilaterally**: This is an acceptable test as per the rubric.
4. **Multi modal pain control including toradol and hydrocodone**: While this is a part of management, it does not fall under the diagnostic workup.
5. **Allow patient to pass at home if small**: This indicates a management plan rather than a diagnostic test.
6. **Surgical intervention if necessary**: This again pertains to management rather than diagnostics.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and acceptable tests (ultrasound and CT), but it does not include any unnecessary tests. The plan is reasonable and includes essential tests without irrelevant ones. 

Given that it encompasses the necessary components while maintaining efficiency, I would rate this as a 3.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Patient presenting to the ER with 1 day of right flank and back pain. He describes the pain as sharp and episodic. The pain travels in to his groin. Each episode lasts around 10-15 minutes and reoccurs every 30 minutes. He has never had previous episodes like this before. He reports 2 episodes of vomiting without blood and dysuria. He reports his diet consists of mostly fast food and sodas. PMH- GOUT PSH- NONE SH- never smoker, no drug use, drinks beer x1 per month FH- Mother has history of Gallstones, Father Diabetic Med- NONE, NKDA ROS: negative unless stated in HPI
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI (History of Present Illness), we can break down the key components against the rubric criteria:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does mention right flank pain, which is essential.
2. **Duration**: The patient states "1 day," which is acceptable.
3. **Character of pain**: The pain is described as "sharp," which is accurate.
4. **Nature of pain**: The patient describes the pain as "episodic," which does not match the required "spasms OR colic every 1-2 hours." Instead, the episodes last "around 10-15 minutes" and recur every 30 minutes, which does not align with the rubric.
5. **Severity**: There is no mention of the severity of the pain on a scale (e.g., 9/10), which is a missing component.
6. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient reports "2 episodes of vomiting without blood," which is acceptable.
7. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient reports dysuria, which is documented.
8. **Hematuria**: The patient does not mention hematuria, which is in line with the rubric.

Overall, the HPI includes many key historical findings, but it is disorganized and misses some critical aspects such as the severity of pain and the specific description of the nature of pain. Given these points, I would rate this section as follows:

- Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, but it is missing pertinent negatives (severity of pain, specific nature of pain).

Thus, the score for this HPI is 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: VITAL: Temp 99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 122/82, O2 99% HEENT- Pupils equal, reactive to light, accomidating. EOM intact. Oral mucosa moist. Cardio- RRR, no murmers or extra heart sounds, palpable DP pulses Pulm- Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abdomin- Soft non-distended, Bowel sounds present. tender to light and deep palpation in right lower quadrant, Positive murphy sign, resonant on percussion, positive rebound tenderness on right side. Right sided CVA tenderness. MSK- streng 5/5 upper and lower extremity
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric:

1. **Normal vitals**: The vital signs are documented and appear normal except for a slightly elevated temperature (99.7°F), which may not be considered abnormal in all contexts. However, they are present.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: This is documented as "Right sided CVA tenderness," which matches the key finding.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The abdominal exam indicates tenderness to light and deep palpation in the right lower quadrant, as well as positive Murphy's sign and rebound tenderness. This contradicts the key finding of "no abdominal tenderness."

Overall, the physical exam findings include several key components, but they are missing a critical negative finding (no abdominal tenderness), and the documentation contains excessive detail that obscures the key points. 

Based on the rubric:
- The presence of normal vitals is noted.
- Positive CVA tenderness is documented correctly.
- Abdominal tenderness is present, which is a significant omission.

Thus, the documentation is organized but lacks some pertinent negatives and includes excessive detail that obscures key findings.

Score: 2

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan presented with sharp colicky pain in the RUQ with dysuria and tendernes to palpation on physical exam. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric, let's break down the essential elements based on the answer key:

1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours - Not mentioned
2. Right flank pain - Not mentioned (RUQ pain is not equivalent to right flank pain)
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity - Not mentioned
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves - The term "colicky" is used, which aligns with this element.
5. Optional elements: Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile - None of these are mentioned.

Now let's assess the summary statement:
- It is missing multiple essential elements (1, 2, and 3). It has only one relevant detail (the colicky nature of the pain), and it does not provide a summary statement that includes all necessary components.

Based on the rubric:
- The statement is missing multiple essential elements.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score:  -@ kidney stones -@ gallstones -@ Appendicitis
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we can analyze each item in relation to the answer key and the rubric criteria.

1. **Kidney stones**: This is consistent with the first item in the answer key (nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic). This is a pertinent diagnosis reflecting the correct interpretation of findings.

2. **Gallstones**: This diagnosis is not mentioned in the answer key and does not relate to the symptoms typically associated with kidney-related issues. It is not consistent with the findings and does not belong in the differential for this patient scenario.

3. **Appendicitis**: Similar to gallstones, appendicitis is not included in the answer key and does not directly relate to the findings suggested by the symptoms of kidney issues. It is also inconsistent with the findings.

Based on this evaluation:
- The inclusion of kidney stones is correct and pertinent.
- The inclusion of gallstones and appendicitis is inconsistent with the findings and not relevant to the patient's symptoms.

The differential diagnosis reflects one correct interpretation and two incorrect interpretations, leading to a somewhat consistent overall assessment, but with significant inaccuracies.

Therefore, according to the rubric, this would fall into the category of "somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized."

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1) Kidney stone is most likely due to the RUQ pain and dysuria. He reports the colicky pain travels into his groin which would be consistent with kidney stones. He reported frequently drinking sugary drinks. 2) Gallstones are possible with his family history, diet, and tenderness on PE. However, less likely without triggers, previous episodes, and acute onset of current presentation. 3) Appendicitis is less likely based on the presentation. However, he did report some RLQ tenderness on palpation. Less likely without fever and presentation of colicky pain. 
Response: To evaluate the provided differential diagnosis support, we will assess how well the diagnoses are linked to the patient's findings based on the rubric.

1) The mention of kidney stones as the most likely diagnosis is appropriate given the reported right flank pain, which is described as colicky and severe. The colicky nature of the pain traveling to the groin aligns well with typical presentations of nephrolithiasis. However, the mention of dysuria is not supported by the key, which lists dysuria under UTI/pyelonephritis but not under kidney stones. The link to sugary drinks, while relevant to kidney stone risk, does not directly support the diagnosis based on the key provided. Overall, this section has some strong points but also contains inaccuracies related to the patient's symptoms.

2) The discussion of gallstones takes into account the family history and diet, which is a reasonable consideration. However, gallstones typically present with right upper quadrant pain rather than flank pain, which could weaken this link. The mention of tenderness on physical exam is relevant but does not strongly support gallstones without other classic symptoms. This section shows some appropriate reasoning but lacks strong connections to the patient's current symptoms.

3) The evaluation of appendicitis is correctly noted as less likely based on the overall presentation and lack of fever, which is consistent with the key. However, the mention of right lower quadrant tenderness does not align with the primary symptoms of flank pain and colicky pain, which weakens this link. This section appropriately identifies appendicitis as a less likely diagnosis but does not provide strong support for its inclusion.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported but contains some inaccuracies and weak links. The student demonstrates an understanding of the conditions but does not fully connect all findings to the diagnoses as outlined in the rubric.

Given the mix of correct and incorrect links, I would score this section as a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: U/A -would deteremine if there is any blood in the urine that would be expected with kidney stones RUQ- would be the initial test for gallstones CT of Abdomen and Pelvis to look for inflammation of appendix if RUQ is negative. 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan against the rubric:

1. The required test of UA (urinalysis) is included, which is essential for determining if there is blood in the urine, relevant for kidney stones.
2. The plan includes a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which is acceptable as it can help in diagnosing conditions such as appendicitis, especially if the RUQ (right upper quadrant) ultrasound is negative.
3. However, the plan mentions "RUQ" without specifying what test is being referred to; if this is an ultrasound, it would be acceptable, but if it implies an endoscopy, it would not be.
4. The plan does not include any unnecessary tests, which is good.

Overall, the plan is reasonable as it includes essential tests (UA and CT) but also introduces some ambiguity with the mention of RUQ without clarification. However, it does not include any unnecessary tests.

Given this analysis, I would score this plan as a 3 for being a reasonable plan that includes most essential tests but lacks clarity on the RUQ mention.

Summary:
Mr. Ryan presented with sharp colicky pain in the RUQ with dysuria and tendernes to palpation on physical exam. 

Differential Diagnosis:
 -@ kidney stones -@ gallstones -@ Appendicitis

Supporting Information:
1) Kidney stone is most likely due to the RUQ pain and dysuria. He reports the colicky pain travels into his groin which would be consistent with kidney stones. He reported frequently drinking sugary drinks. 2) Gallstones are possible with his family history, diet, and tenderness on PE. However, less likely without triggers, previous episodes, and acute onset of current presentation. 3) Appendicitis is less likely based on the presentation.

Plan:
U/A -would deteremine if there is any blood in the urine that would be expected with kidney stones RUQ- would be the initial test for gallstones CT of Abdomen and Pelvis to look for inflammation of appendix if RUQ is negative. 


Response: The organization of the provided note is generally clear, with distinct sections for History of Present Illness, Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. However, there are some minor issues that affect the overall organization:

1. The History of Present Illness (HPI) is well-structured and provides relevant details, but the transition to Past Medical History (PMH), Past Surgical History (PSH), Social History (SH), Family History (FH), Medications (Med), and Review of Systems (ROS) feels abrupt. It could be more clearly delineated.
2. The Physical Examination section is clearly labeled and organized, but there are some typographical errors (e.g., "accomidating" should be "accommodating", "murmers" should be "murmurs", and "streng" should be "strength").
3. The Summary effectively summarizes the key points from the HPI and physical exam, but the transition to the Differential Diagnosis could be clearer.
4. The Differential Diagnosis is listed clearly, but the use of "@" symbols is unconventional and could lead to confusion.
5. The Supporting Information section is detailed and supports the differential diagnosis but could benefit from clearer headings or bullet points for readability.
6. The Plan is presented in a list format, which is appropriate, but the rationale for each test could be more explicitly tied back to the differential diagnoses.

Overall, while the note contains all necessary information and is mostly organized, there are areas that could be improved for clarity and professionalism.

Based on these observations, I would score this section as a 3.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI: Nate Ryan is a middle aged man who presents to the emergency department with acute onset of right flank pain that began yesterday morning. Patient has had a similar pain in the past, but this pain subsided and he did not come to the hospital for it. He says that the pain is intermittent in nature and varies in severity: ranging from 2/10 with a dull aching pain to a 9/10 sharp pain. Pain radiates to the groin on the right side as well. He has tried Tylenol without effect and nothing seems to make the pain worse. ROS: Patient endorses that he has vomited a few times from the pain and vomitus was clear in consistency, endorses stinging with urination since onset of flank pain. Denies any hearing problems or pain in ears, denies congestion or nasal drainage, denies throat pain or cough, denies chest pain or tightness, denies soa, denies any pain in abdomen, denies changes in bowel habits, consistency or contents of stool. Denies any blood in urine or other changes in color. PMH: No medications, NKDA, no chronic illnesses, no prior surgeries or prior hospitalizations, has gotten all immunizations. FH: Mother: DM, gallstones | Father: HTN SH: Lives at home with his wife, socially drinks alcohol every couple of months, does not use tobacco, no illicit drugs, works in an office job without heavy lifting as a component. 
Response: To evaluate the HPI provided, we will assess the key components against the rubric criteria.

1. **Right flank pain**: The student mentions "acute onset of right flank pain" and specifies that it began "yesterday morning," which is good.
2. **Duration**: The student describes the pain as having begun "yesterday morning," which indicates it has been present for about 24 hours, satisfying the acute specification.
3. **Character of pain**: The student describes the pain as "intermittent" and varies between "2/10 with a dull aching pain" to "9/10 sharp pain." While the sharp pain is noted, the variability in severity is less clear than the rubric suggests, as it does not explicitly mention "spasms" or "colic."
4. **Severity**: The student provides a pain scale of 2/10 to 9/10. The highest reported pain of 9/10 meets the rubric's requirement for severe pain.
5. **Associated symptoms**: The student includes nausea and vomiting, noting that the vomitus was "clear in consistency," which aligns with the rubric.
6. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The student mentions "stinging with urination," which suggests dysuria, but does not clearly state urgency. However, they do deny hematuria, which is good.
7. **Missing pertinent negatives**: The student provides a comprehensive review of systems (ROS) and denies several symptoms, which is helpful, but it could be more concise and focused on pertinent negatives related to the chief complaint.

Overall, while the HPI does contain many key elements, it is somewhat disorganized and includes some extraneous information (like detailed family and social history) that could detract from the key findings. The lack of clarity regarding spasms or colic and the less clear mention of urgency affects the completeness of the history.

Based on these considerations, I would assign a score of 3, as most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, but there are some omissions and areas that could be improved.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: T: 99.7 | HR: 85 | RR: 16 | BP: 128/82 | SpO2: 99% RA PE: HEENT: Dentition normal, oropharynx clear, no LAD CV: rrr no mrg, no edema on LE bilaterally, pulses 2+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally. Resp: LCTAB GI: Abdominal inspection revealed no abn, palpation with deep and light touch was not painful. MSK: Palpation of paraspinal and vertebral column did not reveal any pain. GU: Right flank painful to palpation, left flank revealed no pain. Neuro: PERRLA, EOM normal, UE/LE strength 5/5 bilaterally, gait normal. 
Response: In evaluating the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we can assess the following:

1. **Normal vitals**: The vitals are documented and appear normal, which aligns with the answer key.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The note indicates "Right flank painful to palpation," which suggests a positive finding. However, it does not explicitly mention costovertebral angle tenderness, which is a specific location for this type of pain.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The note states "palpation with deep and light touch was not painful," which indicates no abdominal tenderness, aligning with the answer key.

The organization of the physical exam findings is generally good, with sections clearly labeled (HEENT, CV, Resp, GI, MSK, GU, Neuro), and the information is mostly relevant. However, the omission of explicitly stating "costovertebral angle tenderness" could be seen as a missing key positive finding, which is significant in this context.

Overall, while the findings are well organized and mostly relevant, the lack of explicitly stated costovertebral angle tenderness is a critical omission.

Given these points, I would score this section as a 3, as most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but it is missing the pertinent negative (the explicit mention of costovertebral angle tenderness).

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Patient is a middle aged man with an acute onset of sharp, right flank pain, radiating to the groin, with stinging on urination, and pain on strong palpation of right flank. 
Response: To evaluate the provided statement against the rubric and answer key, let's break down the essential elements that should be present:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - The statement mentions "acute onset," which meets this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain** - The statement includes "right flank pain," which meets this criterion.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - The intensity is described as "sharp," but it does not specify a numerical intensity (10/10) or "severe." This element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - The statement does not mention spasms, colic, or the pain coming in waves, which means this element is also missing.
5. **Optional elements** - The statement includes "stinging on urination," which could be considered an optional symptom, but it does not mention non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, or afebrile status.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- The statement includes 2 of the essential elements (acute onset and right flank pain).
- It is missing 2 essential elements (intensity and description of pain pattern).
- The total number of elements mentioned in the statement is 5 (acute onset, right flank pain, sharp pain, stinging on urination, pain on palpation).

Based on the rubric:
- The statement is missing multiple essential elements, so it cannot score a 4 or a 3.
- Since it does include some essential elements but not all, it falls into the category of missing multiple essential elements.

Therefore, the score for this section is:

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis of right flank 2. Choledocholithiasis 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to compare it against the answer key and consider the interpretation of the findings.

1. The first item, "Nephrolithiasis of right flank," aligns well with the answer key's primary diagnosis of nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic. This is pertinent and correctly prioritized based on the symptoms typically associated with kidney stones.

2. The second item, "Choledocholithiasis," refers to the presence of gallstones in the common bile duct, which does not relate to the symptoms typically associated with nephrolithiasis or renal colic. This diagnosis is inconsistent with the findings, as it does not reflect the patient's likely condition based on the provided answer key.

Given this analysis, the differential diagnosis reflects a correct interpretation of one finding (nephrolithiasis) but includes an irrelevant and inconsistent diagnosis (choledocholithiasis). Therefore, the overall differential diagnosis is somewhat consistent with findings but contains a significant flaw.

Based on the rubric:
- The first diagnosis is appropriate, but the second is not consistent with the findings.

Thus, I would score this differential diagnosis as a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Right flank pain, 9/10, sharp in nature, radiating to groin, stinging on urination, history of similar pain in the past. 2. Choledocholithiasis: RUQ pain, sharp pain, 9/10 in severity, maternal history of gallstones. 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we can break down the findings:

1. **Right flank pain, 9/10, sharp in nature, radiating to groin, stinging on urination, history of similar pain in the past.**
   - This aligns with nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) due to the right flank pain being severe, sharp, and possibly colicky. However, the mention of "stinging on urination" suggests a urinary tract infection (UTI), which could indicate a link to pyelonephritis or UTI. The history of similar pain could support the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis but does not provide strong evidence for the other conditions.

2. **Choledocholithiasis: RUQ pain, sharp pain, 9/10 in severity, maternal history of gallstones.**
   - This information does not correlate with the primary symptoms of flank pain described in the rubric for nephrolithiasis or UTI, and it introduces a different diagnosis (choledocholithiasis) that is not supported by the symptomatology presented (flank pain is not typical for choledocholithiasis). 

Given the above analysis:
- The first set of symptoms provides a mixed differential diagnosis, with some support for nephrolithiasis and UTI, but lacks clarity and completeness in linking all findings accurately.
- The second set introduces a diagnosis that does not fit well with the primary symptoms, resulting in confusion.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is weakly supported due to the incorrect links and lack of complete evidence for the suggested conditions.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Renal US to examine for nephroliths, urinalysis to inspect urine for crystals. If these are negative, US of RUQ to inspect for presence of gallstones. 
Response: The provided plan includes a renal ultrasound (acceptable), a urinalysis (required), and a follow-up ultrasound of the right upper quadrant (RUQ) to check for gallstones (acceptable). 

The plan effectively incorporates essential tests required for evaluating the patient's symptoms and does not include any unnecessary tests. The choice to perform a renal ultrasound and urinalysis aligns well with the necessary diagnostic workup. However, the inclusion of the RUQ ultrasound could be seen as unnecessary unless there is a specific indication for gallstones related to the patient's symptoms.

Overall, the plan is reasonable and includes most essential tests, but the additional RUQ ultrasound could be considered an unnecessary test, which slightly detracts from its effectiveness.

Based on this evaluation, I would score this plan a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is being seen in the ED for a 1 day hx of right sided flank pain. He describes the pain as dull and achy with periods of the pain intensifying to a sharp, stabbing pain. He rates the pain 3/10 and 9/10 respectively. He endorses nausea/vomiting, dysuria, chills, and increased urinary urgency that began with the pain. He has had this type of pain before, but it resolved without medical intervention. He has tried OTC pain meds with little relief. No relevant PMHx, Family Hx, or Social Hx ROS negative than described above. 
Response: To evaluate the HPI provided, we can break down the key components based on the rubric:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does mention right-sided flank pain, which is correct.
2. **Duration**: The duration is noted as 1 day, which aligns with the acute nature required.
3. **Quality of pain**: The pain is described as dull and achy with periods of intensification to sharp, stabbing pain. The answer key specifies "sharp" pain, but the description of "sharp" during periods is acceptable.
4. **Pain severity**: The patient rates the pain as 3/10 and 9/10, which indicates a range of severity. The key specifies severe pain as 9/10 but does not provide a lower rating; thus, the lower rating could be seen as a missing detail.
5. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are documented, but the key specifies clear or nonbloody/nonbilious vomiting, which is not mentioned. Dysuria and urgency are noted, but hematuria is explicitly stated as absent.
6. **Relevant history**: The patient mentions previous similar pain that resolved without medical intervention, which is additional context but not part of the key findings.

Overall, while some key information is present, there are several omissions and inaccuracies in the documentation. The pain quality and severity are somewhat misaligned with the rubric, and the vomiting description lacks clarity. Given these factors, the HPI is disorganized and missing key historical findings.

Based on the rubric, this HPI would fit into the category of "Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key)."

2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: 99.7F, 85 BPM, 16 RR, 128/82, 99% RA Gen- Appears uncomfortable. Otherwise well appearing. HENT- Pupils reactive, EOM nrml. Oral cavity without deformities. Neuro- Strength 5/5 bilaterally in upper and lower extremities. Cardio- No m/r/g, regular r/r. Pulses 2+ in bilateral LE Resp- Chest CTA Abd- Positive CVA tenderness on the right side. Nrml BS. No tenderness, guarding, or rebound. MSK- No LE edema 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we will consider the following aspects:

1. **Key physical exam findings**: The answer key specifies normal vitals, positive costovertebral angle tenderness, and no abdominal tenderness. The provided physical exam notes include normal vitals, positive CVA tenderness, and explicitly state "No tenderness, guarding, or rebound," which aligns with the answer key's requirement of no abdominal tenderness.

2. **Organization**: The findings are well-organized by system (vitals, general, HENT, neuro, cardio, respiratory, abdominal, musculoskeletal), which helps in clarity and understanding.

3. **Conciseness and relevance**: While the note includes additional details (e.g., "appears uncomfortable," "strength 5/5 bilaterally"), these do not detract from the key findings and provide a more complete picture of the patient's condition.

4. **Missing pertinent negatives**: The note does not seem to omit any key findings as it includes all necessary components from the answer key.

Given these considerations, the physical exam findings are thorough, well-organized, and include all key findings from the answer key with relevant details included. Therefore, this submission meets the criteria for a score of 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan, a middle aged male, comes to ED with 1 day hx of flank pain, dysuria, N/V, and low grade fever. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement, we will check for the essential elements based on the answer key:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement indicates a "1 day hx" which fits the "past 24 hours" criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement mentions "flank pain," but it does not specify that it is on the right side. This is a missing element.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: There is no mention of the intensity of pain in the statement.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement does not include any information about spasms, colic, or wave-like pain.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement mentions "N/V" (nausea/vomiting) and "low grade fever," but it does not mention "non-bilious vomiting," "right groin pain," or "afebrile."

Based on the analysis:
- The statement has the acute onset element but is missing the right flank specification, the intensity of pain, and the description of the pain pattern. Therefore, it is missing multiple essential elements.

According to the rubric:
- The score for missing multiple essential elements would be a 2.

2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1.) Nephrolithiasis - Causing Ureter Obstruction 2.) Pyelonephritis 
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is a correct interpretation of the patient's symptoms, particularly if there are indications of renal colic or obstruction, which aligns with the findings related to urinary symptoms and pain.
2. Pyelonephritis is also a relevant diagnosis, especially if there are signs of infection or systemic symptoms.

The differential diagnoses reflect an understanding of the patient's potential conditions and are prioritized correctly based on the likelihood of these conditions given the symptoms. However, the absence of an optional diagnosis such as muscle strain or inguinal hernia does not detract from the appropriateness of the primary differential diagnoses listed.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is pertinent and prioritized correctly, with no significant flaws that would impact patient care.

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1.) Nephrolithiasis - Pain in flank which is dull and achy with periods of intense sharp pains. - Similar episodes in the past. - Temp of 99.7F and dysuria may suggest possible infection due to urine obstruction. 2.) Pyelonephritis - CVA tenderness on exam - Dysuria and urinary urgency 
Response: To evaluate the provided differential diagnosis support, we need to assess how well the student's notes align with the answer key and the rubric criteria.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: 
   - The student describes flank pain as "dull and achy with periods of intense sharp pains." This description does not fully align with the answer key, which specifies "sharp," "intermittent or colic," and "severe or 9/10 pain." The mention of "similar episodes in the past" is relevant but does not compensate for the inaccuracies in the pain description.
   - The temperature of 99.7F and mention of dysuria suggest a possible infection, which could indicate a complication, but the link to nephrolithiasis is not robustly supported.

2. **Pyelonephritis**:
   - The student notes CVA tenderness, which aligns with the answer key. Additionally, mentioning dysuria and urinary urgency is correct and supports the diagnosis of pyelonephritis.
   - However, the lack of specific mention of acute sharp pain in the flank, which is a key symptom, makes the support less complete.

Overall, while the student has made some connections to the differential diagnoses, the links are weak in the case of nephrolithiasis due to the inaccurate description of pain. The pyelonephritis support is stronger but still lacks some critical elements. 

Given these considerations, the student's differential diagnosis is weakly supported with several incorrect links between findings and diagnoses.

1. **UA**: This is required and included in the plan, which is good.
2. **CBC and CMP**: While these tests are often useful in various clinical scenarios, they are not listed as required or acceptable in the answer key. Their inclusion may be considered unnecessary in this context.
3. **CT abdomen and pelvis**: This test is acceptable according to the answer key, so its inclusion is appropriate.
4. **Empiric antibiotics**: This is a reasonable consideration if the clinical condition worsens, but it's not a diagnostic test.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and an acceptable CT scan, but it also includes the unnecessary CBC and CMP. This means that the plan is reasonable but not entirely efficient as it includes some unnecessary tests.

Response: The organization of the provided note is quite structured and follows a logical flow, separating the history of present illness, physical examination, summary, differential diagnosis, supporting information, and plan into distinct sections. Each component is clearly labeled and the information within each section is relevant to the patient's case. There are no apparent repetitions or misplaced information. 

However, the summary section could be considered slightly redundant, as it repeats some of the information already presented in the history of present illness without adding new insights or clarity. Despite this, the overall organization remains intact.

Based on the rubric, this note demonstrates that most features are organized with information presented in appropriate sections, with only minor issues regarding redundancy.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: -Pain in back and groin for 24 hours -Pain worse on right side -9/10 severity and intermittent -Not relieved by tylenol -Missed work today -Associated nausea -Pt is worried it could be gallstones because his mom had gallstones in the past ROS: No fever, constant nausea, vomited once, no constipation/diarrhea, burning sensation present with urination, has sense of urgency with urinating, no blood in urine PMH: Gout Prior hosp: none Meds: none Social hx: No smoking, occasional drinker, sexually active, married, and works in life insurance FH: Mom had galbladder removed, dad with HTN and T2DM Surgical Hx: None
Response: The provided history of present illness (HPI) contains several elements that are both relevant and important for understanding the patient's condition. However, there are also some omissions and areas where the organization could be improved.

1. **Right flank pain**: The note mentions "pain in back and groin," which could imply flank pain but is not explicitly stated. The right side pain is noted, but the specificity of "flank" is missing.
2. **Duration**: The duration of "24 hours" is present.
3. **Character of pain**: The pain is described as "worse on right side" but does not explicitly mention it as "sharp" or "spasms/colic," which are important descriptors.
4. **Severity**: The severity of "9/10" is included.
5. **Associated symptoms**: The note includes nausea and mentions vomiting once, which is relevant. However, it lacks mention of whether the vomiting was clear or nonbloody/nonbilious, which is important.
6. **Dysuria and urgency**: The note mentions a burning sensation and urgency with urination, which is relevant, but it does not explicitly state dysuria. It does mention "no blood in urine," which is good.
7. **Pertinent negatives**: There are some pertinent negatives noted (no fever, no constipation/diarrhea, no blood in urine), but the absence of clear documentation about the character of the pain and the vomiting could be considered a lack of pertinent negatives.

Overall, while the HPI does contain some key information, it is somewhat disorganized and omits important descriptors and details that would make it clearer. Therefore, I would score this section as a 2, as many key historical findings are omitted and the history is disorganized or poorly documented.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp 99.7, HR 85 , RR 16, BP 128/82, Oxygen 99% on RA General/Psych: Normal appearance, mood, cleanliness, mild distress due to pain HEENT: Oral exam showed healthy teeth and gums, no inflammation/swelling of the throat Neck: Lymph nodes normal to palpation, No enlargement of the parathyroid gland to palpation Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs or S3 auscultated, no LE edema, normal lower extremity pulse, normal radial pulse Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation Abdominal: Costovertebral angle tenderness present on the right with light touch but absent on the left. Bowel sounds present on auscultation, inspection of abdomen shows healthy skin and no abnormal swelling, no abnormal vasculature, no pain on palpation of abdomen in all quadrants, no rebound tenderness or referred tenderness, liver 2cm below costal margin, normal resonance to percussion Neuro/MSK: Extraocular movement fully functional, normal pupillary reflex, upper/lower extremity strength intact, normal gait
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we will look for the presence of key physical exam findings as outlined in the answer key.

1. **Normal vitals**: The vital signs are documented and are mostly normal, with a slight fever (Temp 99.7). While technically not "normal," they are relevant and presented clearly.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: This finding is present, as the note indicates costovertebral angle tenderness on the right side.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The note states "no pain on palpation of abdomen in all quadrants," which aligns with the requirement of documenting pertinent negatives.

Now, let's assess the overall organization and relevance of the findings:
- The physical exam findings are presented in a structured manner, with clear sections for each body system.
- While the vital signs include a slight fever, the rest of the findings are relevant and organized.
- The note includes pertinent positives and negatives, particularly regarding abdominal tenderness.

However, there are some details that could be seen as excessive (e.g., detailed descriptions of the cardiovascular and neurological systems) which may obscure the key findings.

Based on the rubric:
- Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and organized.
- There is a missing explicit mention of the normality of abdominal tenderness (though it is implied).
- The overall organization is good, but some details could be trimmed for conciseness.

Considering these factors, the score for this section would be a 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan (Nate) is a 55 year old male with a past medical history of gout, presenting with 24 hours of burning sensation with urinating, nausea, and intermittent flank pain of 9/10 severity radiating to the groin.
Response: To evaluate the provided summary against the rubric, we will identify the essential elements present in Mr. Ryan's note:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - The note states "24 hours," which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain** - The note mentions "intermittent flank pain," but it does not specify that it is on the right side.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - The note states "9/10 severity," which is close but does not meet the criterion of "10/10 intensity OR severe intensity."
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - The note mentions "intermittent flank pain," which suggests some form of spasms or colic, but it is not explicitly stated.
5. **Optional elements** - The note includes "nausea," which is optional, but it does not mention non-bilious vomiting or afebrile status.

Now, let's tally the essential elements:

- Element 1: Present
- Element 2: Missing (not specified as right flank pain)
- Element 3: Missing (severity does not meet the required threshold)
- Element 4: Ambiguous (intermittent suggests some form of spasms but is not clearly stated)
- Element 5: Optional element (nausea is present)

The summary is missing multiple essential elements (specifically elements 2 and 3 are clearly not met), and element 4 is not clearly fulfilled either. Therefore, based on the rubric:

- The note is missing multiple essential elements.

2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Kidney stones 2. UTI 3. Pyelonephritis
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes kidney stones, UTI, and pyelonephritis. 

1. **Kidney stones** (nephrolithiasis/renal colic) is accurately included and reflects a correct interpretation of the findings, assuming the symptoms align with this condition.
2. **UTI** is also appropriately included, as it is a common consideration given urinary symptoms.
3. **Pyelonephritis** is a logical follow-up to UTI and kidney stones, as it represents a progression of infection that could be relevant based on the patient's symptoms.

The differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings and is prioritized correctly, as kidney stones and UTIs are more common and would be considered first, followed by pyelonephritis. There are no significant flaws in prioritization that would negatively impact patient care.

Based on the rubric, this differential diagnosis reflects correct interpretation of findings.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Kidney stones -Costovertebral angle tenderness that is intermittent and unilateral -Associated nausea but minimal vomiting -Burning sensation with urination -High sense of urgency with urinating 2. UTI -Burning sensation with urinating -Less likely than kidney stone due to intermittent nature of pain with high severity, unilateral CVA tenderness, and male gender 3. Pyelonephritis -Costovertebral angle tenderness -Burning sensation with urination -Less likely than kidney stone due to lack of fever that should be seen with pyelonephritis
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis based on the provided support, let's analyze the connections made to the patient findings:

1. **Kidney Stones**: 
   - The note mentions costovertebral angle tenderness, which is relevant, but it is described as "intermittent and unilateral" rather than acute and severe as per the criteria for nephrolithiasis. 
   - Nausea is noted, but the vomiting is described as minimal, which differs from the clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious vomiting expected.
   - The mention of a burning sensation with urination and high sense of urgency does not align with typical kidney stone presentations, which may not always include those symptoms.

2. **UTI**: 
   - The note includes burning sensation with urination, which is a typical symptom.
   - The rationale for considering UTI as less likely due to the intermittent nature of pain and the other findings is somewhat valid, but it does not fully address the links to the patient's symptoms, particularly the lack of dysuria or urgency noted in the original rubric.

3. **Pyelonephritis**: 
   - Costovertebral angle tenderness is relevant, but the lack of fever is a significant reason to consider it less likely; however, the rationale provided does not strongly connect the findings to the diagnosis.

Overall, while there are attempts to support the differential diagnoses, the connections are either incomplete or incorrect in relation to the patient's symptoms and the expected presentations. The reasoning lacks strong supports for the diagnoses, particularly with the kidney stones and UTI, which are crucial given the patient's history and symptom presentation.

Based on this analysis, the score reflects a weakly supported differential diagnosis with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: KUB ultrasound to locate stone and determine size -Surgery if stone is too big to pass on its own or if it is causing severe hydronephorosis -Manage with pain medication and antiemetic if stone small enough to pass on its own Urinalysis for possible UTI STI screen for burning with urination BMP to calcium levels 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we need to assess whether it aligns with the rubric criteria and the answer key.

1. The required test, a urinalysis (UA), is included in the plan, which is essential.
2. The plan includes a KUB ultrasound, which is acceptable for locating stones.
3. A BMP is included, which is also acceptable as it helps in assessing calcium levels.
4. The mention of a renal ultrasound is acceptable as well.
5. However, the plan does not include any unnecessary tests, which is a positive aspect.

Overall, the plan is reasonable as it includes essential tests (UA, KUB ultrasound, BMP) and does not include any unnecessary tests. Therefore, it aligns with the criteria for a reasonable plan for diagnostic workup.

Summary:
Mr. Ryan (Nate) is a 55 year old male with a past medical history of gout, presenting with 24 hours of burning sensation with urinating, nausea, and intermittent flank pain of 9/10 severity radiating to the groin.

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Kidney stones 2. UTI 3. Pyelonephritis

Supporting Information:
1. Kidney stones -Costovertebral angle tenderness that is intermittent and unilateral -Associated nausea but minimal vomiting -Burning sensation with urination -High sense of urgency with urinating 2. UTI -Burning sensation with urinating -Less likely than kidney stone due to intermittent nature of pain with high severity, unilateral CVA tenderness, and male gender 3.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: CC: right flank pain HPI: Mr. Ryan is a middle age man presenting with 2 days of right flank pain. Pain began yesterday morning as dull pain in right flank, but several times in the past two days has flared to 9/10 intense stabbing pain for several minutes at a time. Burning with urination. No gross hematuria, no difficulty with bowel movements. Patient has tried Tylenol, which has not alleviated the pain. Patient has felt nauseous and vomited several times due to the pain flairs. Patient has been able to eat and drink, normal diet is well-balanced and consists of yogurt, oatmeal, sandwiches, carrots, chicken, fish, pasta. Meds: no Allergies: nka PMH: none PSH: none FH: father has HTN, diabetes; mother had gallstones and cholecytectomy SH: patient has alcohol 1x per month; patient does not use tobacco products or recreational drugs; patient is sexually active with his wife. ROS: negative except for the nausea and vomiting 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided HPI against the rubric criteria.

1. **Key Information Present**: The chief complaint (CC) of right flank pain is stated. However, the timeline indicates 2 days of pain instead of the specified 24 hours of acute pain in the answer key. The description of the pain starts as dull and then becomes sharp, which partially aligns with the key information, but it does not mention spasms or colic. The severity of the pain is documented as 9/10, which is correct.

2. **Nausea and Vomiting**: The patient has experienced nausea and vomiting, which is mentioned. However, the vomiting is described as several times without specifying if it is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious, which is a detail noted in the answer key.

3. **Dysuria and Urgency**: The patient reports burning with urination, which could imply dysuria, but it does not explicitly state urgency. The absence of hematuria is noted, which is correct.

4. **Overall Organization**: The HPI is somewhat organized but could benefit from better clarity regarding the pain characteristics and the associated symptoms. There is some irrelevant information regarding the patient's diet, which does not contribute to the HPI.

Based on these observations:
- Key information is partially present, but some important details are missing or inaccurately described.
- The history is somewhat organized but lacks conciseness and focus on key symptoms.

Thus, the score for this HPI would fall between the second and third levels of the rubric.

2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: -Temp: 99.7 F -HR: 85bpm -RR: 16 -BP: 128/82mmHg -O2 sat: 99% on RA PE: - constitutional: well-appearing, AAOx3, appropriate mood and affect - CV: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops; 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally, no peripheral edema - Respiratory: clear vesicular breathing with normal effort bilaterally, no crackles, no wheezing - Neuro: full strength in arms and legs bilaterally -HEENT: pupils equal and reactive to light and accommodate, EOM intact; oropharynx clear of exudates, no uvular deviation; no enlarged cervical lymph nodes, no tenderness to palpation - GI: no tenderness to palpation of LUQ, gastric area, RUQ, LLQ, suprapubic area, or RLQ; no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly; positive bowel sounds - GU: tenderness to percussion of right lower back over kidney; costovertebral angle tenderness 
Response: The provided physical exam findings include a comprehensive list of normal and abnormal findings. The vital signs are documented correctly and indicate normal values. The exam findings cover multiple systems, including constitutional, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, HEENT, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary. 

However, while the majority of key findings are present and organized, there are some pertinent negatives missing. For instance, while the gastrointestinal section mentions the absence of tenderness in various areas, it does not explicitly state whether there are any other pertinent negatives such as bowel obstruction or issues related to bowel function. Additionally, the absence of any mention of neurological deficits could be considered a missing pertinent negative.

Overall, the documentation is thorough and organized, but it lacks some key pertinent negatives that would provide a more complete picture. Therefore, based on the rubric:

2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Middle age man presents with dull right flank pain and costovertebral angle tenderness with dysuria, elevated temperature, and intermittent pain flare-ups.
Response: To evaluate the provided note against the rubric, let's identify the essential elements from the answer key that are present:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - The note does not specify if the pain is acute or occurred in the past 24 hours.
2. **Right flank pain** - This element is present as the note mentions "right flank pain."
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - The intensity of the pain is described as "dull," which does not meet the criteria for this element.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - The note mentions "intermittent pain flare-ups," which could be interpreted as spasms or colic, but it is not explicitly stated.
5. **Optional elements** - The note includes "elevated temperature," which could be seen as a sign of fever, and "dysuria," but these do not match the optional elements provided.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- The note is missing the element of acute onset or a timeframe.
- The intensity of pain does not meet the criteria for severe.
- While it does mention right flank pain and intermittent pain flare-ups, it does not clearly fulfill the criteria for spasms or colic.

Based on the rubric:
- The note is missing multiple essential elements (acute onset and severe intensity).
- It does not include a summary statement that encapsulates all required elements.

Thus, the score for this section is 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1) Kidney stone: costovertebral angle tenderness, colicky right flank pain, dysuria, mildly elevated temperature 2) UTI: febrile, dysuria 3) Pyelonephritis: febrile, dysuria, costovertebral angle tenderness
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we will analyze the links between the symptoms presented and the diagnoses listed.

1) **Kidney Stone**: 
   - The symptoms of colicky right flank pain and costovertebral angle tenderness are appropriate for nephrolithiasis. However, the presence of dysuria and a mildly elevated temperature could suggest a urinary tract infection, which is not typically a primary symptom of kidney stones. The interpretation of the symptoms does not fully align with the typical presentation of kidney stones, as dysuria is not a classic symptom.

2) **UTI**: 
   - The symptoms of being febrile and experiencing dysuria are relevant and correct for a urinary tract infection. However, the lack of flank pain and costovertebral angle tenderness makes this diagnosis less likely to be the primary issue without further context.

3) **Pyelonephritis**: 
   - The symptoms of being febrile, experiencing dysuria, and having costovertebral angle tenderness are all consistent with pyelonephritis. This is a strong link and supports the diagnosis well.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is somewhat supported, but there are some inaccuracies in linking the findings to the diagnoses. The connections are not entirely complete, particularly regarding the kidney stone diagnosis, which may lead to potential misinterpretation of the patient's condition. 

Considering these factors, I would rate the differential diagnosis as follows:
- The differential diagnosis is appropriately supported but has some incorrect links that could lead to confusion regarding the primary diagnosis. 

Thus, I would assign a score of 3.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Renal Bladder Ultrasound, CBC with differential, urinalysis with cultures If the above tests are not diagnostic, CT abdomen
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we will analyze the tests included against the rubric criteria and the answer key.

1. **Required Test**: The plan includes a urinalysis (UA), which is required.
2. **Acceptable Tests**: The plan includes a renal bladder ultrasound, which is acceptable, and mentions a CT abdomen if the other tests are not diagnostic, which is also acceptable.
3. **Unacceptable Tests**: There are no unacceptable tests included in the plan.

Now, let’s assess the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the plan:
- The inclusion of the UA is essential.
- The renal bladder ultrasound is acceptable and relevant to the workup.
- The CBC with differential is not listed as required or acceptable according to the rubric, which means it could be seen as unnecessary in this context.
- The plan mentions a CT abdomen, which is acceptable, but it is contingent on the other tests not being diagnostic, indicating a potential inefficiency.

Overall, the plan includes essential tests (UA and renal ultrasound), but the inclusion of the CBC with differential could be seen as unnecessary, which detracts from the overall effectiveness of the plan.

Given this analysis, the plan is reasonable but includes some unnecessary tests.

Final score: 3

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 55 yo male with a hx of gout who presents for acute, sharp right flank pain. Pain started 24 hours ago. 9/10 in severity. 2-20 min episodes. 2/10 in between episodes. Pain starts in back right flank and radiates to groin. First time has has had this pain. Pt endorses urinary urgency and mild burning pain upon urination. Denies hematuria and discharge. Endorses normal urine volume and color. Endorses nausea and vomiting. Denies constipation, diarrhea, blood in stool, CP, SOB, headache, dizziness. Last BM was today. Endorses gout hx in his right bit toe 2 years ago. Can't recall name of medication he takes for gout. Denies previous surgeries, hospitalizations, allergies. Denies smoking, tobacco use, drugs. Reports no problems with sexual hx. Endorses healthy diet, exercise, and hydration. Endorses Dad has HTN and DM II. Mom had gall stones and gallbladder disease. 
Response: In evaluating the provided history of present illness (HPI), we can break down the key components based on the answer key:

1. **Right flank pain**: Present and described as acute, sharp, and 9/10 in severity.
2. **Duration**: Correctly noted as starting 24 hours ago.
3. **Pain characteristics**: The patient describes episodes of pain (2-20 min), which does not align perfectly with the "spasms or colic every 1-2 hours" from the answer key, but indicates some form of episodic pain.
4. **Nausea and vomiting**: Present, with the patient endorsing normal urine volume and color, which aligns with the answer key.
5. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient endorses urinary urgency and mild burning pain upon urination, which indicates dysuria.
6. **Hematuria**: Denied, which is correct.

However, there are some omissions and issues:
- The description of the pain episodes does not clearly mention the "spasms or colic" aspect.
- The history of gout is noted, but the medication aspect is vague as the patient cannot recall the name.
- While the additional historical context about family history and personal history is present, it may be considered somewhat irrelevant to the acute presenting complaint.

Overall, the HPI contains most of the key information but lacks clarity in some areas and includes some irrelevant details. It is somewhat organized but not entirely concise due to the additional historical context that doesn't directly pertain to the acute issue.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as a 3: "Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives."

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: General appearance: pt looks uncomfortable, anxious on exam table Right CVA tenderness to tender palpation, bouncing off table T- 99.7 HR- 85 RR- 16 BP- 128/82 Oxygen- 99% on RA
Response: The provided physical exam findings include the following:

1. General appearance: patient looks uncomfortable, anxious on exam table
2. Right CVA tenderness to tender palpation, bouncing off table
3. Vital signs: T- 99.7, HR- 85, RR- 16, BP- 128/82, Oxygen- 99% on RA

Now, let's evaluate these findings against the rubric:

- The vital signs are reported as normal, which aligns with the answer key.
- The positive finding of costovertebral angle tenderness is represented by the right CVA tenderness noted, which is a key positive finding.
- However, there is no mention of abdominal tenderness, which is a pertinent negative that is missing.
- The organization of the findings is somewhat clear, but the description of the general appearance could be considered a bit verbose or irrelevant to the key findings, as it does not directly relate to the physical exam findings.

Based on this evaluation:
- The presence of key positive findings is noted, but the absence of pertinent negatives detracts from the overall quality.
- The organization is reasonable, but the additional detail about the patient's appearance could be seen as somewhat irrelevant.

Therefore, I would score this section as a 3, reflecting that most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 55 yo male with a hx of gout who presents for acute, sharp right flank pain and right CVA tenderness. 
Response: To evaluate the provided statement based on the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements present in Nathaniel Ryan's note:

1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours: The note mentions "acute," which satisfies this requirement.
2. Right flank pain: The note states "sharp right flank pain," which satisfies this requirement.
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity: The intensity is described as "sharp," which does not specify a numeric value or "severe," so this element is missing.
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves: There is no mention of spasms, colic, or wave-like pain, so this element is also missing.
5. Optional elements: There are no optional elements mentioned, such as non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, or afebrile.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Present: Acute onset, right flank pain
- Missing: Intensity, spasms/colic/wave pain
- Optional: None

According to the rubric:
- The note has 2 essential elements present but is missing multiple essential elements (specifically, intensity and the nature of the pain).

Thus, the score for this section would be a 2.

2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1- Nephrolithiasis 2- Pyelonephritis
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis (kidney stone) and pyelonephritis (UTI/pyelonephritis), which are both relevant to the symptoms typically associated with renal issues. The prioritization of nephrolithiasis as the first diagnosis is appropriate given that it is often a more acute presentation compared to pyelonephritis. 

There are no major flaws in the prioritization, and the differential diagnoses reflect a correct interpretation of the findings related to the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the response aligns well with the rubric criteria.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting

- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1- Nephrolithiasis -pt looks anxious and uncomfortable on exam -acute, sharp right flank pain -radiates to groin -positive right CVA tenderness, bouncing off table -hx of gout -negative for fever -9/10 severity -pain episodes lasting from 2-20 min -stable vital signs 2- Pyelonephritis -right flank pain -9/10 severity, sharp -right CVA tenderness 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis based on the provided support and the answer key, we need to analyze the connections made between the patient findings and the potential diagnoses.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: 
   - The symptoms of acute, sharp right flank pain that radiates to the groin are consistent with nephrolithiasis. 
   - The patient is described as anxious and uncomfortable, which aligns with the typical presentation of renal colic.
   - The presence of positive right costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness supports this diagnosis.
   - The history of gout is relevant, as it may predispose the patient to kidney stones.
   - The pain severity of 9/10 and episodes lasting from 2-20 minutes are also characteristic of renal colic.
   - Overall, the connections made for nephrolithiasis are strong and well-supported.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: 
   - The right flank pain and severity of 9/10 are relevant, and the right CVA tenderness supports the diagnosis of pyelonephritis.
   - However, there is a lack of additional classic symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, or fever, which are typically associated with pyelonephritis. This makes the link less robust than for nephrolithiasis.

Given these considerations, the differential diagnosis for nephrolithiasis is excellent and well-supported, while the support for pyelonephritis is appropriate but lacks some critical links. 

Therefore, I would score this section as follows:
- Nephrolithiasis: Excellent support (4 points)
- Pyelonephritis: Appropriately supported but missing key links (3 points)

Since the overall differential diagnosis is primarily driven by the excellent support for nephrolithiasis, I would score this section as a 3, as the missing links for pyelonephritis do not negatively impact patient care significantly.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: -1 day hx of intermittent right flank pain -9/10 at its greatest severity -no known aggravating or relieving factors -associated with n/v, burning with urination, and urinary urgency -no changes in urine color or odor -no fever, diarrhea, or constipation. -OTC tylenol did not relieve pain. -Had similar episode a couple of years ago. Resolved on its own. -on regular medications or chronic medical conditions -no prior hx of surgeries -occasional EtOH, no drugs or tobacco. 
Response: To evaluate the provided HPI (History of Present Illness) against the rubric, we will analyze the key components based on the answer key.

1. **Right flank pain**: The student mentions "intermittent right flank pain," which is relevant but does not specify if it is acute or chronic. The time frame of "1 day" is present, which aligns with the acute nature of the pain.
   
2. **Pain characteristics**: The student indicates "9/10 at its greatest severity," which is a good detail. However, they do not mention if the pain is sharp or describe it as spasms or colic, which are key descriptors from the answer key.

3. **Nausea and vomiting**: The student includes "associated with n/v," but does not specify if it is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious, which is important information.

4. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The student mentions "burning with urination and urinary urgency," which aligns with dysuria and urgency. However, they do not explicitly state whether there is hematuria, which is a pertinent negative that should be documented.

5. **Other symptoms**: The student states "no changes in urine color or odor," which is relevant, and they also mention "no fever, diarrhea, or constipation," which are pertinent negatives as well.

6. **Treatment history**: They mention that OTC Tylenol did not relieve pain, which is relevant, but they also provide information about a previous similar episode and their regular medications/chronic conditions, which may not be directly relevant to the current acute episode.

Overall, while the student provides some relevant information, several key components from the answer key are missing, including the description of the pain, the specifics of nausea and vomiting, and the pertinent negative regarding hematuria. The organization is somewhat clear, but the omission of key details obscures the overall picture.

Given these points, I would score this HPI as a 2, since many key historical findings are omitted, and the history is somewhat disorganized or poorly documented.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Middle-aged male presenting with acute onset intermittent right flank pain without fever associated with dysuria, urinary urgency, n/v.
Response: To evaluate the provided statement against the rubric, we first need to identify the essential elements from the answer key and see which ones are present in the statement.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - Present (acute onset)
2. **Right flank pain** - Present (right flank pain)
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - Not explicitly stated (intensity not mentioned)
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - Not mentioned (spasms or colic not included)
5. **Optional elements** - Non-bilious vomiting is present (n/v), but the other optional elements are not applicable.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- The statement includes 2 essential elements (acute onset, right flank pain).
- It is missing 2 essential elements (intensity and description of pain).
- The total number of elements mentioned is 5 (which includes the essential and optional elements).

According to the rubric:
- Since multiple essential elements are missing, the score would be a 2.

Final score: 2

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Urinary Tract Infection
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and urinary tract infection (UTI). 

1. Nephrolithiasis is a strong candidate given the symptoms typically associated with kidney stones, such as severe flank pain and hematuria, which align with the findings.
2. Urinary tract infection is also a relevant differential diagnosis, particularly if there are accompanying symptoms like dysuria or frequency, which could indicate a UTI or pyelonephritis.

The differential diagnoses presented are pertinent and prioritize nephrolithiasis appropriately as the primary concern, followed by UTI, which is consistent with the findings. There are no significant flaws in prioritization that would negatively impact patient care.

Given this analysis, I would rate the differential diagnosis as generally consistent with findings, with appropriate prioritization.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute

- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis - intermittent, sharp flank pain. Associated with nausea and vomiting. Absence of fever. +Right CVA tenderness on exam. No suprapubic tenderness. Prior self resolving episode of similar sx. 2. UTI - Urinary urgency and dysuria. +right CVA tenderness. 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis support provided, we will break down the two diagnoses mentioned: nephrolithiasis and UTI.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**:
   - The description includes intermittent, sharp flank pain, which aligns with the expected symptomatology.
   - Associated nausea and vomiting are noted, which is consistent with nephrolithiasis.
   - The absence of fever is relevant, as fever may suggest infection rather than stone disease.
   - Right costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness is present, which supports the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis.
   - The mention of a prior self-resolving episode of similar symptoms adds additional support to this diagnosis.
   - Overall, the links to the findings and diagnosis are accurate and complete.

2. **UTI**:
   - The presence of urinary urgency and dysuria is appropriately noted, which are common symptoms associated with UTI.
   - Right CVA tenderness is also mentioned, which can be indicative of pyelonephritis, a more severe form of UTI.
   - However, the absence of fever or other systemic symptoms may detract slightly from the strength of this diagnosis in the context of UTI.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well supported, with correct links to patient findings for nephrolithiasis. The UTI diagnosis is appropriately supported but could be considered less robust due to the absence of fever and additional symptoms.

The evaluation of the differential diagnosis shows that it is appropriately supported, with some missing links that would not negatively impact patient care.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. urinalysis to work up urinary infection/microscopic hematuria. 2. Noncontrast abdominal CT to examine for kidney stone/signs of kidney infection. 3. CBC/CMP to assess for systemic infection and kidney function. 
Response: The provided plan includes the following tests:

1. Urinalysis (UA) – This is required and appropriate for working up urinary infection/microscopic hematuria.
2. Noncontrast abdominal CT – This is acceptable for examining kidney stones or signs of kidney infection.
3. CBC/CMP – While a BMP is acceptable for assessing kidney function, a CBC/CMP is not specifically listed as acceptable in the rubric.

The plan includes the required UA and an acceptable CT scan, but it also includes a CBC/CMP instead of the specified BMP, which means it has some unnecessary elements. Overall, the plan is reasonable but not entirely efficient, as it misses the essential BMP and incorporates an unnecessary test.

Based on the rubric, this plan aligns with a score of 3: a reasonable plan that includes most essential tests but also some unnecessary tests.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nate is a 60yo male that presents right side pain x2 days. The pain started yesterday morning and is located near his right flank. The pain is constant with a dull ache but occationally worsens and becomes sharp. It radiates to his right groin. Has has tried tylenol which did not help his pain. Nothing makes it worse. He feels as though he can't get comfortable when the pain worsens. He also has had nausea that is worse when the pain intensifies and he has vomited 2x. He has also had dysuria and urinary urgency. Denies blood in his urine. He also denies fever, HA, rash, URI symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. He has never had anything like this before. He denies any fall or injuries but he has recently starting exercising again and thinks it could be associated with muscle soreness. He is also worries about gallstones. PMH - none. no medications, surgeries or hospitalizations FHx - mother has choleocystectomy, father had HTN and DM2; has 2 brothers who are healthy. Has 2 kids who are healthy. SHx - works in an office; recently started exercising again; rare alcohol use, no tobacco or drug use. 
Response: To evaluate the provided HPI against the rubric, we will assess the presence and organization of key information based on the answer key.

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does report right side pain, but it is noted as being present for "x2 days" instead of "x24 hours or acute," which is a slight deviation from the expected timeframe.
2. **Pain characteristics**: The pain is described as "constant with a dull ache but occasionally worsens and becomes sharp." While this includes the sharp aspect, it does not mention spasms or colic every 1-2 hours, which is a key detail from the rubric.
3. **Severity of pain**: The patient does not quantify the pain (e.g., 9/10), which is a missing detail.
4. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient has nausea and has vomited twice, but the description does not specify that the vomit is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious, which is another key detail.
5. **Dysuria and urgency**: These symptoms are documented, and the denial of hematuria is present, which is good.
6. **Pertinent negatives**: The patient denies fever, headache, rash, URI symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath, and diarrhea, which is thorough and organized.

Overall, while most key positive historical findings are documented, there are several omissions (specifically around pain characteristics, severity, and details regarding nausea/vomiting). The history is somewhat organized but lacks conciseness due to the inclusion of additional details that do not directly address the rubric's key findings.

Given these points, I would score this HPI as a 2, as many key historical findings are omitted and the history is somewhat disorganized.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: VS: Temp - 99.7 HR - 85 RR - 16 BP - 128/82 O2 - 99% on RA General - NAD HENT - mucous membrane pink and moist, without lesion and erythema; no cervical LAD Neuro - PERRL, EOMI, 5/5 strength in upper and lower extremities bilaterally; normal gait Resp - clear to auscultation bilaterally, normal effort CV - RRR, no murmurs, rubs or gallops; no LE edema; dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally Abd - normal bowel sounds, no tenderness or palpation, resonant to percussion, normal liver span and no tenderness or palpation of liver, negative Murphy's sign, spleen not palpable, pain on palpation and percussion of right costovertbral area 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to identify if all key findings from the answer key are present and how well they are organized:

1. **Normal vitals**: The vital signs are provided and are normal, which meets the key finding requirement.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The note states "pain on palpation and percussion of right costovertbral area," indicating this finding is present.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The note states "no tenderness or palpation" in the abdominal section, which aligns with the key finding of no abdominal tenderness.

Now, let's assess the organization and conciseness of the physical exam findings:

- The physical exam findings are detailed and organized into clear sections (VS, General, HENT, Neuro, Resp, CV, Abd).
- All key findings from the answer key are present, including the normal vitals, costovertebral angle tenderness, and absence of abdominal tenderness.
- There is no irrelevant information present; the details are relevant to the physical examination.

Considering these points, the documentation meets the criteria for "Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information."

Thus, the score for this section is:

4

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nate is a 60yo male that presents with acute onset right flank pain that radiates to the groin and associated with vomiting, dysuria, and physical exam positive for costovertebral tenderness. 
Response: Let's break down the provided statement according to the rubric criteria and the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "acute onset," which fulfills this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement mentions "right flank pain," which fulfills this criterion.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The statement does not specify the intensity of the pain (e.g., 10/10 or severe), so this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement does not mention spasms, colic, or that the pain comes in waves, so this element is also missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement includes "associated with vomiting," which is an optional element, but it also mentions "dysuria" and "costovertebral tenderness," which are not in the optional list.

Now, let's evaluate based on the rubric:
- The statement has two essential elements present (acute onset and right flank pain).
- It is missing multiple essential elements (intensity and description of pain).
- The total count of elements exceeds 5 due to the additional details provided (vomiting, dysuria, costovertebral tenderness).

Based on this evaluation, the score would fall under the category of "Missing multiple essential elements."

1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: Nephrolithiasis Pyelonephritis 
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is a relevant diagnosis given the common presentation of renal colic symptoms, which is consistent with the findings of a patient who may be experiencing acute abdominal or flank pain.
2. Pyelonephritis is also a pertinent differential, especially if there are accompanying symptoms such as fever, chills, or urinary symptoms, which could indicate an infection related to the urinary tract.

Both diagnoses are appropriate and prioritize the most likely conditions based on typical symptomatology. However, since the differential diagnosis is limited to only two options, it may be perceived as somewhat narrow, but it does not appear to be overly broad or inaccurately prioritized. 

Given this analysis, I would rate the differential diagnosis as generally consistent with findings, with some minor flaws in terms of breadth.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: Nephrolithiasis - acute onset flank pain, pain radiates to the groin, renal colic, nausea and vomiting, costovertebral tenderness Pyelonephritis - acute onset flank pain, nausea and vomiting, costovertebral tenderness, hx of dysuria and urinary urgency 
Response: The student has provided a differential diagnosis that includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. 

For nephrolithiasis:
- The student mentions acute onset flank pain, which aligns with the key points.
- The description of pain radiating to the groin and renal colic is accurate and well-supported.
- Nausea and vomiting are included, which is also correct.
- However, there is no mention of the severity of the pain or the specific rating (9/10), which is a detail that could enhance the support.

For pyelonephritis:
- The student again mentions acute onset flank pain, which is correct.
- Nausea and vomiting are included, which is appropriate.
- Costovertebral tenderness is mentioned, which is a key finding.
- However, the history of dysuria and urinary urgency is noted, but it should be explicitly linked to the patient's findings in the interview to strengthen the connection.

Overall, the differential diagnoses provided are appropriate and mostly supported, but there are some missing details that could improve the overall strength of the links. The connections made are sufficient to suggest a reasonable differential diagnosis without significantly compromising patient care.

Given these observations, I would rate this section as a 3.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Urine analysis for assess for infection and microscopic hematuria CBC to check WBC to assess for infection
Response: The plan provided includes a urine analysis (UA), which is required and appropriate for assessing for infection and microscopic hematuria. However, it also includes a CBC (Complete Blood Count) to check WBC, which, while it may provide some information, is not listed as an essential or acceptable test in the rubric. The plan does not include any of the acceptable tests such as CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, or renal ultrasound.

Given that the plan includes one essential test (UA) but also introduces an unnecessary test (CBC) without including any of the recommended acceptable tests, this plan can be considered a reasonable plan that includes most essential tests but also some unnecessary ones.

Thus, the score for this plan is 3.

Response: The organization of the provided clinical note is generally clear and follows a structured format. Each section is appropriately labeled and contains relevant information pertaining to the patient's history, physical examination, summary, differential diagnosis, supporting information, and plan. There are no significant issues with disorganization, and the information is presented in a logical sequence.

However, while the note is well-organized, there are a few minor areas where clarity could be improved, such as ensuring that all relevant details are succinctly presented without unnecessary repetition. Despite this, the overall organization is strong.

Given these observations, I would assign a score of 4 for this section.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: 55 year old man with PMH of gout presents with 24 hours of right flank pain radiating to his right groin. He describes the pain as sharp and coming in "spasms" every 1-2 hours. He also reports dysuria and urinary urgency that started around the same time. He denies hematuria. Denies fever. Reports Nausea and vomiting. Has vomited 1-2 times over the last 24 hours. Vomit is clear. Denies this pain ever happening before. PMH: gout 2 years ago meds: none allergies: none SH: rarely drinks alcohol (once per month), denies drug use, denies tobacco use FH: cholelithiasis and cholecystectomy in his mother, father with DM and HTN ROS: per HPI
Response: The provided HPI includes most of the necessary elements outlined in the answer key. The patient reports:

- Right flank pain for 24 hours (acute)
- Describes the pain as sharp
- Pain comes in spasms every 1-2 hours
- Rates the pain as severe (though not explicitly stated as 9/10, the severity is implied)
- Reports nausea and vomiting (with details that the vomit is clear, which is appropriate)
- Reports dysuria and urgency
- Denies hematuria
- Denies fever

While the pain severity is not explicitly quantified as 9/10, the overall documentation is organized and includes relevant information. There are no significant omissions of key historical findings, and the information is presented in a concise manner without irrelevant details.

Based on the rubric, this HPI closely aligns with level 3, as it documents most key positive historical findings well but misses the explicit rating of pain severity.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Temp: 99.7, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, SpO2: 99% on RA general: well appearing, no distress HEENT: normal dentition, no throat erythema, normal EOM of eyes, normal pupillary response to light neck: no LAD CV: RRR, no M/R/G Lungs CTAB Back: Flank tenderness to light palpitation on right side, No TTP of left flank Extremities: 2+ strength of bilateral UE and LE. 2+ radial and PT pulses. Abdomen: No TTP, normal bowel sounds, nondistended Gait: normal
Response: Based on the provided physical exam findings and the answer key, we can evaluate the documentation against the rubric criteria.

1. **Normal vitals**: The student documented normal vital signs, which is a key positive finding.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The student documented "Flank tenderness to light palpitation on right side," which suggests some degree of costovertebral angle tenderness but does not explicitly confirm it as a positive finding.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The student documented "No TTP" (tenderness to palpation) in the abdomen, which aligns with the answer key.

Now, evaluating the organization and completeness:
- The key physical exam findings are mostly present, including vitals, general appearance, HEENT, cardiovascular, respiratory, abdomen, and extremities.
- The documentation is generally well organized, but the interpretation of the costovertebral angle tenderness could be clearer. The omission of explicitly stating "costovertebral angle tenderness" means it does not fully meet the key findings.

Given that most key findings are documented and organized but missing the explicit mention of costovertebral angle tenderness, I would score this section as follows:

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: 55 year old man with PMH of gout presents with 24 hours of sharp right flank pain radiating to his right groin, dysuria, urinary frequency, no fevers, and right flank TTP on the right.
Response: Let's evaluate the provided summary against the rubric and the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The note states "24 hours," which meets this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The note mentions "sharp right flank pain," which meets this criterion.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not explicitly stated in the summary provided, so this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The note does not mention spasms, colic, or that the pain comes in waves, so this element is also missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The note includes "dysuria," "urinary frequency," and "right flank TTP," but it does not mention non-bilious vomiting or afebrile.

Now, let's count the essential elements:
- Present: 2 (acute onset and right flank pain)
- Missing: 2 (intensity and spasms/colic)

Since the summary is missing multiple essential elements, according to the rubric, this would be scored as a 2.

2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1.) Nephrolithiasis 2.) pyelonephritis
Response: The provided differential diagnoses include nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. 

1. **Nephrolithiasis** is a correct diagnosis given the context of symptoms typically associated with kidney stones, such as flank pain, hematuria, and possibly urinary symptoms. This aligns well with findings related to renal colic.

2. **Pyelonephritis** is also a relevant diagnosis, as it can present with similar symptoms, including flank pain and urinary symptoms, particularly if there is an infection associated with the kidneys.

Both of these diagnoses are pertinent to the patient's symptoms and show a good understanding of the possible conditions based on the findings. There are no significant flaws in prioritization, as nephrolithiasis is often considered a primary concern when symptoms suggest renal involvement.

Overall, the differential diagnosis accurately reflects the findings and is appropriately prioritized.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1.) Nephrolithiasis: Sharp right flank pain radiating to his groin, right flank TTP, no fevers, Hx of gout. 2.) pyelonephritis: Right flank pain, right flank TTP, and dysuria and urgency makes this a possibility. No fevers and radiation to right groin makes this less likely.
Response: In evaluating the differential diagnosis provided, we can break down the support for each diagnosis according to the rubric criteria.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The student mentions sharp right flank pain, which is acute and severe, aligning with the key points for nephrolithiasis. The mention of tenderness in the right flank (TTP) and the patient's history of gout supports this diagnosis well. The absence of fever is also consistent with this diagnosis, as kidney stones do not typically present with fever unless there is a complication like infection. Therefore, this part of the differential diagnosis is well supported.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: The student notes right flank pain and tenderness, which can be indicative of pyelonephritis. However, they also mention dysuria and urgency, which are relevant symptoms. The student correctly identifies that the absence of fever and the lack of radiation to the groin makes this diagnosis less likely, which shows a nuanced understanding of the differential. However, while the diagnosis is appropriately supported, the reasoning could be a bit clearer regarding how the absence of fever impacts the likelihood of pyelonephritis compared to nephrolithiasis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported for nephrolithiasis, and while there are some valid points for pyelonephritis, the reasoning has some weaknesses. There are no incorrect links, but the support for pyelonephritis could be stronger.

Given this analysis, I would rate this differential diagnosis as:

Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CT abdomen and pelvis to look to kidney stones/ signs of pyelonephritis. UA to look for UTI.
Response: The plan provided includes a CT abdomen and pelvis to investigate kidney stones and signs of pyelonephritis, which is an acceptable test. Additionally, a UA is included to check for a UTI, which is a required test. 

There are no unnecessary tests included in the plan. The use of the CT scan is reasonable given the symptoms presented, and the UA is essential for the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection.

   - Duration: "began yesterday morning" indicates a 24-hour timeframe.
   - Pain character: Described as "constant pain," "usually dull," and "episodes of sharp stabbing pain."
   - Severity: "At its worst, the pain is 9/10."
   - Associated symptoms: Nausea and vomiting are mentioned, and dysuria is noted.
   - Pertinent negatives: Hematuria is explicitly denied, which is good, but other negatives like the absence of diarrhea or constipation are included, which may not be necessary for the HPI.

2. **Conciseness and Organization**:
   - The information is mostly organized chronologically and thematically (pain, associated symptoms, social history).
   - However, the mention of family history and social history feels somewhat disjointed from the main focus of the HPI, which could be seen as slightly irrelevant to the immediate concern of flank pain.

3. **Missing Key Information**:
   - The description of the pain lacks specific mention of spasms or colic, which is a key part of the rubric.
   - While nausea and vomiting are included, they should be described as "clear or nonbloody/nonbilious" to meet the criteria fully.

Overall, the HPI is fairly well documented and organized but lacks some key details, particularly regarding the pain's character and the specific description of nausea and vomiting. 

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 3, as most key positive historical findings are documented and organized, but there are some missing pertinent negatives and specific details.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: temp 99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, oxygen 99% on RA HEENT: equal and reactive pupils, EOM in tact, good dentition, oropharynx not erythematous, no exudates. No cervical LAD, no thyroid enlargement or nodules. Heart: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2. No peripheral edema. 2+ pulses DP, PT bilaterally Resp: no additional breath sounds, regular rate, normal effort MSK: 5/5 strength in upper and lower extremities GI: abdomen soft, non tender, active bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants GU: no suprapubic tenderness, costovertebral tenderness on the right, no costovertebral tenderness on the left Neuro: 2+ patellar and biceps reflexes, normal gait 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam (PE) findings against the rubric, we need to assess the presence and organization of key findings as outlined in the answer key.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vitals are documented, but the temperature is slightly elevated (99.7°F), which may not be considered "normal." Therefore, this aspect is partially fulfilled.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The note states "costovertebral tenderness on the right," which matches the answer key. However, it also states "no costovertebral tenderness on the left," which is an important negative finding.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The findings indicate "abdomen soft, non tender," which aligns with the requirement.

In assessing the organization and relevance of the findings:
- The documentation is relatively well-organized, covering multiple systems (HEENT, Heart, Resp, MSK, GI, GU, Neuro).
- While most key positive findings are present, the inclusion of the elevated temperature and the right-sided costovertebral tenderness without the pertinent negative for the left side indicates some omissions.

Overall, while the note is organized and includes many relevant findings, the inaccuracies regarding the vitals and the omission of pertinent negatives (specifically, the left costovertebral angle) detract from the completeness.

Based on the rubric:

- The presence of most key findings is noted, but the presence of inaccuracies and omissions leads to a lower score.

Final score: 2

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle aged man presenting to ED for concerns of right flank pain for 2 days and has been taking tylenol with little relief. He is hemodynamically stable. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric and answer key, we will break down the essential elements that should be included based on the answer key:

1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours: The statement mentions "for 2 days," which does not specify acute onset or the timeframe of the past 24 hours. This element is missing.
2. Right flank pain: This is present in the statement.
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity: The statement mentions "little relief" but does not specify the pain intensity as 10/10 or severe. This element is missing.
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves: This element is not mentioned in the statement.
5. Optional elements: Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile: None of these optional elements are mentioned.

Based on the evaluation:
- Missing essential elements: Acute onset, pain intensity, spasms/colic/waves.
- Total essential elements present: 1 (right flank pain).
- Total elements: 1 (right flank pain) + 0 (other elements) = 1 total element.

Since multiple essential elements are missing, the score according to the rubric would be a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. pyelonephritis 2. Kidney stone 3. UTI 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we will compare it to the answer key and the rubric criteria.

The answer key lists nephrolithiasis (kidney stone/renal colic) and UTI/pyelonephritis as the primary differential diagnoses. The optional diagnoses include muscle strain and inguinal hernia.

The student's differential diagnosis includes:
1. Pyelonephritis
2. Kidney stone
3. UTI

Evaluation:
- The student's differential diagnosis includes both pyelonephritis and UTI, which are consistent with the answer key.
- The inclusion of "kidney stone" is also correct as it is synonymous with nephrolithiasis.
- However, the order of prioritization might not reflect the most common or urgent conditions based on typical clinical presentations, as both pyelonephritis and UTI are closely related and could be seen as overlapping conditions.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings, and while the prioritization could be improved (as UTI might be considered before pyelonephritis in some contexts), it does not significantly detract from patient care.

Based on the rubric:
- The differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. pyelonephritis - though he is not currently febrile at 99.7, he has been taking tylenol at home to help control pain. He has unilateral R sided costovertebral tenderness, dysuria, nausea, and vomiting 2. Kidney stone - afebrile, episodic worsening sharp flank pain 3. UTI - dysuria 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis presented, let's break it down according to the rubric:

1. **Pyelonephritis**: 
   - The student notes unilateral right-sided costovertebral tenderness, dysuria, nausea, and vomiting. 
   - The absence of fever (though he is afebrile at 99.7) is mentioned, but the rationale that he has been taking Tylenol for pain control suggests some level of discomfort that could align with pyelonephritis. 
   - Overall, the links to the diagnosis are mostly correct, but the lack of fever could be a critical factor that is not fully addressed.

2. **Kidney Stone**: 
   - The student describes episodic worsening sharp flank pain, which is consistent with renal colic. 
   - However, the absence of specific details about the pain (intensity, duration, and whether it is colicky) makes this diagnosis less supported than it could be.

3. **UTI**: 
   - The mention of dysuria is appropriate, but the student does not provide additional supporting symptoms such as urgency or frequency, which would strengthen the link to a UTI diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnoses presented are appropriate, but there are several missing or incomplete links that do not fully support the diagnoses. The rationale for pyelonephritis could have been stronger, and the kidney stone and UTI diagnoses lacked completeness in their supporting details. 

Given these considerations, I would score this section as a 2 for weakly supported differential diagnosis with several incorrect or incomplete links.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: IV Fluids - normal saline UA with culture CT stone protocol - w/o contrast pain management Ppx: 1 g IM ceftriaxone 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, let's compare it against the criteria in the rubric and the answer key.

1. The plan includes a UA with culture, which is a required test. This is essential and aligns with the rubric's expectations.
2. The plan also includes IV fluids (normal saline), which while not listed as a required test, may be reasonable for patient management but does not directly pertain to the diagnostic workup.
3. The CT stone protocol without contrast is acceptable according to the answer key, as it is a reasonable diagnostic imaging choice.
4. The plan includes pain management, which is appropriate but again not a direct part of the diagnostic workup.
5. The plan includes 1 g IM ceftriaxone for prophylaxis. While this may be relevant for treatment, it does not fit into the diagnostic workup category.
6. There are no unnecessary tests included in the plan, which is a positive aspect.

Overall, the plan is reasonable, includes essential tests (UA and CT), and does not include unnecessary tests. However, it does not fully align with the rubric's requirement for an effective and efficient workup since it includes elements that are more therapeutic than diagnostic.

Given these points, I would rate this plan as a 3, as it includes most essential tests but also incorporates some elements that are not strictly part of the diagnostic workup.

Mr. Ryan is a middle aged male presenting to ED for concerns of right flank pain that began yesterday morning. He expressed that he is in constant pain, it is usually dull but has episodes of sharp stabbing pain. At its worst, the pain is 9/10. He denied any aggravating factors. He has been taking tylenol which mildly helps with the pain. He has associated nausea, vomiting, and dysuria. He denied issues of diarrhea, constipation, and hematuria. This pain has caused him to miss work. He is worried about this being a gallbladder issue because his mother had gallstones and needed his gallbladder removed. He reports he is only sexually active with his wife. Patient declined medication to treat N/V, pain is biggest concern ROS: otherwise noted in HPI declined cardio or pulm symptoms Social hx: No tobacco use Occasional alcohol use - once a month lives with his wife, feels safe at home Family hx: mom had gallstones No meds NKA Had an episode like this a few years ago that was similar and went away quickly 

Physical Examination:
Vitals: temp 99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, oxygen 99% on RA HEENT: equal and reactive pupils, EOM in tact, good dentition, oropharynx not erythematous, no exudates.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle-aged man with a 1-day history of intense right sided flank pain with associated nausea and vomiting. He has had dysuria and and had increased urinary frequency. He has not had a fever. He recently used a rowing machine at the gym which he has not done before. His past medical history is significant for gout. He has had no changes in his stool, changes in skin color or blood in his urine. 
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI (history of present illness) against the rubric, we can break down the key components:

1. **Right flank pain**: The student mentions "intense right sided flank pain," which aligns with the key finding of right flank pain.
2. **Duration**: The student indicates a "1-day history," which is similar but not exactly the same as "x24 hours or acute." This is acceptable but slightly less precise.
3. **Pain characteristics**: The description of pain as "intense" does not specify whether it is sharp or colicky, which is a key missing detail.
4. **Pain severity**: The severity of pain is not quantified (e.g., 9/10), which is another omission.
5. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are mentioned, but the student does not specify if the vomitus is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious.
6. **Dysuria and urgency**: The student notes "dysuria and had increased urinary frequency," but does not mention urgency specifically. The presence of dysuria is documented, but the urgency aspect is not clear.
7. **Hematuria**: The student states "no blood in his urine," which is a pertinent negative finding that is included.
8. **Other relevant history**: The mention of past medical history (gout) and recent physical activity (rowing machine) provides context but does not directly pertain to the HPI of the acute symptoms.

Overall, while the student has included several key pieces of information, there are critical omissions regarding the specific characteristics of pain, its severity, and the nature of the vomiting. The organization is relatively clear, but the missing details detract from the completeness of the HPI.

Considering these points, I would score this section as a 2, as many key historical findings are omitted and the history is somewhat disorganized.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vital signs: Temp: 99.7, HR: 85, RR: 16, BP: 128/82, O2 99% HEENT: EOM intact, PERRLA, no cervical LAD CV: No murmurs, rubs or gallops, dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ on both feet, no pedal edema Lungs: Equal breath sounds, no crackles or wheezes Abd: Bowel sounds normoactive, no tenderness in any quadrants, abdomen is soft, CVAT MSK: 5/5 strength in upper and lower extremities 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to identify the key findings that were outlined in the answer key: 

1. Normal vitals
2. Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
3. No abdominal tenderness

Now, let's analyze the provided physical exam findings:

1. **Vital signs**: All vital signs are documented and appear normal, which aligns with the "normal vitals" requirement.
2. **Costovertebral angle tenderness**: The findings do not mention costovertebral angle tenderness, which is a key positive finding from the answer key. Instead, the exam states "CVAT" (costovertebral angle tenderness) is noted as "no tenderness," which indicates that this key finding is not present.
3. **Abdominal tenderness**: The exam states "no tenderness in any quadrants," which correctly reflects the requirement of "no abdominal tenderness."

Overall, the physical exam findings include normal vitals and appropriately document the absence of abdominal tenderness. However, they fail to document the positive finding of costovertebral angle tenderness, which is a significant omission.

Based on the rubric:
- The presence of normal vitals and the absence of abdominal tenderness is noted.
- The key positive finding of costovertebral angle tenderness is omitted.

Since most key positive physical exam findings are missing (specifically the CVAT), and the documentation is organized but lacks this pertinent positive finding, I would score this a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle aged man with a history of gout who presents with one day of right sided flank pain with vomiting and dysuria. 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric and the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "one day," which indicates acute onset. This element is present.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement specifies "right sided flank pain." This element is present.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not specified in the statement. This element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement does not mention spasms, colic, or waves of pain. This element is missing.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement includes "vomiting" and "dysuria," which are optional elements. 

Now, let’s summarize the findings:
- Present elements: 2 (acute onset and right flank pain)
- Missing elements: 2 (intensity and description of pain)
- Optional elements included: 2 (vomiting and dysuria)

According to the rubric:
- The summary is missing multiple essential elements (specifically the intensity of the pain and the description of how the pain presents).
- Since there is no summary statement included that meets the criteria of having all essential elements, this would fall into the category of "Missing multiple essential elements."

Thus, the score for this summary statement is:

2

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1) Uric Acid Kidney stone 2) Pyelonephritis 3) Costochondritis 
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes:

1) Uric Acid Kidney Stone
2) Pyelonephritis
3) Costochondritis

Evaluating this against the answer key:

1. **Uric Acid Kidney Stone** is a specific type of nephrolithiasis. While it is a valid diagnosis, it is more specific than what was provided in the answer key (which listed nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic). This could be seen as a minor flaw in interpretation but still reflects an understanding of the condition.
   
2. **Pyelonephritis** is correctly identified and aligns with the answer key.

3. **Costochondritis** is not included in the answer key and is not relevant to the primary symptoms typically associated with kidney stones or urinary tract issues. It may indicate a lack of focus on the pertinent symptoms related to the patient's presenting complaints.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings, but the inclusion of Costochondritis detracts from the prioritization of the most relevant diagnoses. Therefore, I would rate this as having minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care.

1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is most likely presenting with a kidney stone. Given his history of gout it is likely a uric acid kidney stone. This is supported by his flank pain, CVAT, dehydration, and nausea and vomiting. He could also have pyelonephritis which is less likely due to lack of fever and other systemic systems but would be supported by his CVAT, dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Finally, he could just have costochondritis due to using the rowing machine at the gym which he had not done previously. 
Response: In evaluating the provided differential diagnosis, we can break down the components as follows:

1. **Nephrolithiasis/Kidney Stone/Renal Colic**: The student correctly identifies this as the most likely diagnosis. They mention flank pain, which is acute, sharp, and consistent with renal colic. The inclusion of the patient's history of gout adds support for the possibility of a uric acid stone. However, the mention of "dehydration" is not explicitly supported in the answer key, which could weaken this link slightly.

2. **UTI/Pyelonephritis**: The student considers pyelonephritis as a differential diagnosis but acknowledges that it's less likely due to the absence of fever and other systemic symptoms. They mention costovertebral angle tenderness (CVAT), which is relevant, but they incorrectly include dysuria and increased urinary frequency as supporting symptoms when these were not provided in the initial patient interview. This incorrect link detracts from the strength of this differential.

3. **Muscle Strain**: The student mentions costochondritis due to a recent workout, which is a reasonable consideration given the context. However, they incorrectly link this to right flank pain rather than recognizing that muscle strain typically does not present with flank pain in the context provided. 

4. **Inguinal Hernia**: This diagnosis is not mentioned at all, which is a notable omission. 

Overall, while the student has made an effort to present a differential diagnosis, there are several incorrect links, particularly regarding the UTI/pyelonephritis and muscle strain considerations. The absence of inguinal hernia is also a significant oversight. 

Given these observations, I would rate this differential diagnosis as weakly supported with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis.

I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CT with IV contrast: will help to show size of the stone which will delineate therapy. Would also show pyelonephritis. UA and culture: Due to patient having dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Would put pyelonephritis higher on the differential if + for leukocytes and nitrites. CBC to show leukocytosis would make costochondritis less likely if WBC increased 
Response: In evaluating the provided plan for diagnostic workup against the rubric, we can break down the components:

1. **CT with IV contrast**: This test is acceptable as it could help visualize the stone and assess for pyelonephritis, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.

2. **UA and culture**: This is a required test and is appropriate given the patient's dysuria and increased urinary frequency. It effectively addresses potential urinary tract infection concerns.

3. **CBC**: While this test can provide useful information, it is not listed as a required or acceptable test in the answer key. The rationale provided (to assess for leukocytosis and make costochondritis less likely) does not directly address the primary concerns of urinary issues, which could be seen as unnecessary in the context of the other tests.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and an acceptable CT, but it also includes an unnecessary CBC. Given that it includes most essential tests but has some unnecessary components, this plan falls under the description of a "reasonable plan for diagnostic workup" with some unnecessary tests.

Thus, the score for this plan is 3.

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a middle aged man with a history of gout who presents with one day of right sided flank pain with vomiting and dysuria. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1) Uric Acid Kidney stone 2) Pyelonephritis 3) Costochondritis 

Supporting Information:
Mr. Ryan is most likely presenting with a kidney stone. Given his history of gout it is likely a uric acid kidney stone. This is supported by his flank pain, CVAT, dehydration, and nausea and vomiting. He could also have pyelonephritis which is less likely due to lack of fever and other systemic systems but would be supported by his CVAT, dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Finally, he could just have costochondritis due to using the rowing machine at the gym which he had not done previously.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr Ryan is a middle aged man with hx of gout who present today with complain of right flank pain that started 3 days ago. Per patient, he normally drinks 2-3 liter of fluids per day. Three days ago, he went to the gym to workout and after the gym he started having shooting pains in the right flank. He took tylenol but it did not help. The pain has cause him to vomit 2x. He denies fever, hematuria but did endorses burning pain with urination. Review of system is negative except what is reported in the hpi.
Response: To evaluate the HPI provided, let's break down the key components based on the answer key:

1. **Right flank pain**: The student mentions "right flank pain" but states it started 3 days ago instead of the required 24 hours or acute. This is a significant omission.
   
2. **Pain characteristics**: The description of the pain as "shooting pains" does not align with the required "sharp" or "spasms/colic every 1-2 hours." Additionally, the severity of the pain is not documented (missing the 9/10 rating).

3. **Nausea and vomiting**: The student mentions vomiting but does not specify that it was clear or nonbloody/nonbilious, which is pertinent information.

4. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The student notes "burning pain with urination," which indicates dysuria, but does not mention urgency. 

5. **Hematuria**: The student correctly denies hematuria, which is good.

Overall, the HPI is lacking in several key areas: the timing of the pain, the description of the pain's characteristics, the details regarding nausea and vomiting, and the urgency aspect of urinary symptoms. The organization is somewhat clear, but the omissions significantly affect the completeness of the history.

Given these points, I would score this HPI as a 2 because many key historical findings are omitted, and the history is somewhat disorganized or poorly documented.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: VS: BP: 128/82; HR:85; RR: 16 TM: 99.2; SPO2: 99 on RA HEENT: NC/AT, nares patent and nml hearing, No LAN Resp: Nml resp. effort, CTAB, absent wheezes or rale CVD: Nml S!, S2, no edema , pulse +2 Abd: Nml BS, no point tenderness. Right CVA tenderness on Palpation MSK; 5/5 LE and UE strength Neuro: No focal deficit. Absent patellar reflex Skin: No skin lesion 
Response: To evaluate the physical exam findings based on the answer key provided, we need to assess the completeness and organization of the findings reported.

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are reported as normal (BP: 128/82; HR: 85; RR: 16; TM: 99.2; SPO2: 99 on RA), which aligns with the key.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: The note mentions "Right CVA tenderness on Palpation," which is a positive finding and matches the key.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note states "no point tenderness" in the abdomen, which suggests that there is no abdominal tenderness, aligning with the key.

Now, let's analyze the organization and completeness:
- The physical exam findings are well organized by system (vital signs, HEENT, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and skin).
- There are no irrelevant details, and all key findings from the answer key are present.
- There are no missing pertinent negatives that could affect the understanding of the patient's condition.

Based on this analysis, the documentation meets the criteria for a score of 4 as it includes almost all key physical exam findings, is concise, well-organized, and contains little irrelevant information.

2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr Ryan is a middle aged man with hx of gout who present today with complain of right flank pain and right CVA tenderness
Response: To evaluate this note based on the rubric provided, we need to identify the essential elements present in the statement and compare them to the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - This element is missing.
2. **Right flank pain** - This element is present.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - This element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - This element is missing.

Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Kidney stone 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Hydro nephritis due to stone
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes:

1. Kidney stone (nephrolithiasis/renal colic) - This is consistent with the findings and is the primary concern given the patient's symptoms.
2. Pyelonephritis (UTI/pyelonephritis) - This is also relevant as it can be a secondary complication of a kidney stone and is consistent with the findings.
3. Hydronephritis due to stone - This is a reasonable consideration as it reflects a potential complication of a kidney stone but is not explicitly listed in the answer key.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with the findings presented. However, the inclusion of "hydonephritis due to stone" is not as directly relevant as the listed options in the answer key and may indicate a minor flaw in prioritization.

Given this evaluation, the differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Kidney stone: Recent training wthout adequate fluid, CVA tendernes and shooting flank pain 2. Pyelonephritis: Buringing pain with urination but lack of fever, unilateral CVA are against 3. Hydronephritis due to stone: Could likely to be present as a complication of the stone
Response: Let's evaluate the differential diagnosis provided based on the rubric and the answer key.

1. **Kidney Stone**: The reasoning mentions "recent training without adequate fluid," which could be linked to dehydration leading to kidney stones. However, it incorrectly mentions "CVA tenderness" without supporting it with specific findings from the patient (the original answer key states that CVA tenderness is positive for UTI/pyelonephritis). The "shooting flank pain" is relevant and aligns with the symptoms of nephrolithiasis. Overall, this part shows some understanding but lacks complete accuracy in linking findings.

2. **Pyelonephritis**: The mention of "burning pain with urination" aligns with UTI/pyelonephritis; however, the lack of fever is noted, which is a critical symptom that would typically be present in pyelonephritis. The statement "unilateral CVA are against" is vague but suggests that the absence of significant CVA tenderness is a negative finding. This section is somewhat supported but lacks the necessary connections to fully justify pyelonephritis.

3. **Hydronephrosis due to stone**: The reasoning here indicates that hydronephrosis could be a complication of a stone, which is accurate. However, this diagnosis would typically require additional supportive findings or symptoms, which are not detailed in the provided information. 

Overall, the differential diagnosis provided has some relevant points but lacks accurate links to patient findings and contains several incorrect or vague connections. It does not fully support the diagnoses with the necessary details from the patient’s symptoms.

Given this evaluation, I would score this section a 2 for weakly supported differential diagnosis with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. UA, CBC, and CMP 2. US , xray/CT if US is not definitive; Some stones are not visible on xray. 
Response: To evaluate the plan for diagnostic workup, we need to assess it based on the rubric provided.

1. **Required Tests**: The plan includes a UA, which is a required test. However, it also includes CBC and CMP, which are not specified as required in the answer key.
   
2. **Acceptable Tests**: The plan mentions a renal ultrasound (US), which is acceptable. It also suggests x-ray/CT if the US is not definitive, which aligns with the acceptable tests.

3. **Unacceptable Tests**: There are no unacceptable tests included in the plan.

Now, looking at the overall effectiveness:
- The UA is included, which is essential.
- The CBC and CMP are not required or mentioned in the answer key, which could be seen as unnecessary.
- The inclusion of the renal ultrasound is good, and the mention of x-ray/CT if necessary shows a reasonable approach.

However, the presence of CBC and CMP could detract from the efficiency of the plan since they are not essential and could be considered unnecessary.

Given this analysis, the plan is reasonable but includes some unnecessary tests while covering most of the essential tests.

Therefore, I would score this plan as a 3.

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does mention right-sided flank pain, which is relevant.
2. **Duration**: The pain is noted to have started "yesterday," which is consistent with the required "x24 hours or acute" timeframe.
3. **Character of pain**: The patient describes the pain as "dull" and "always there," which does not fully align with the required "sharp" description. The mention of "zaps" is somewhat vague and does not meet the criteria for spasms or colic.
4. **Severity**: The patient rates the pain as "9/10 at its worst," which is aligned with the requirement.
5. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are documented, which matches the criteria. However, the vomiting description is not specific (it should indicate clear or nonbloody/nonbilious).
6. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The patient complains of burning with urination and urinary frequency, which meets the requirement.
7. **Hematuria**: The patient denies blood in the urine, which is correctly documented.

Overall, while the HPI captures most of the relevant information, it has some omissions and inaccuracies, particularly regarding the character of the pain and the specificity of the vomiting. The organization is generally good, but the inaccuracies and omissions affect the overall quality of the documentation.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 2, as many key historical findings are omitted or inaccurately described.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 O2 99% HEENT: PERRL, normal extraoccular movement, normal dentition, moist mucus membranes, no lymphadenopathy CV: normal rate and rhythm, no murmurs, no S3 or S4, normal posterior tibial pulses, no LE edema Resp: normal breath sounds GI: normal inspection, normal bowel sounds, no tenderness to palpation. Right CVA tenderness to palpation MSK: normal strength in upper and lower extremities, normal gait
Response: In evaluating the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we can see the following:

1. **Key Physical Exam Findings**: The note includes vital signs, which are normal, and it documents positive costovertebral angle tenderness. However, it does not explicitly mention the absence of tenderness in specific areas like the abdomen, which is a pertinent negative finding that is missing.

2. **Organization and Conciseness**: The information is presented in a structured manner, with clear headings for different systems (HEENT, CV, Resp, GI, MSK). However, while the details are thorough, there is a slight risk of overwhelming the reader with extensive detail, which could obscure the key findings.

3. **Key Findings**: The note includes many relevant physical exam findings, such as normal breath sounds, normal strength, and normal vital signs, but the absence of pertinent negatives (specifically the lack of abdominal tenderness) detracts from the completeness.

Based on this analysis, the performance aligns closely with the criteria for a score of 3. Most key positive findings are documented and organized well, but the omission of pertinent negatives (abdominal tenderness) prevents it from achieving a higher score.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a middle aged man with a history of gout that presents with acute colicky right flank pain, dysuria and urinary frequency concerning for nephrolithiasis. 
Response: Let's evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement indicates "acute" which meets this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement includes "right flank pain," which is also present.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The statement does not specify the intensity of the pain, so this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement mentions "colicky" pain, which satisfies this requirement.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement includes "dysuria" and "urinary frequency" but does not mention any of the optional elements like "non-bilious vomiting" or "right groin pain."

Now, let's count the essential elements:
- Present: Acute onset, right flank pain, colicky pain
- Missing: Intensity of pain (10/10 or severe)

According to the rubric:
- The statement is missing 1 essential element (the intensity of pain).
- The total number of elements mentioned is 3, which is fewer than 5.

Thus, the score based on the rubric would be a 3, as it is missing 1 essential element and has fewer than 5 total elements.

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. nephrolithiasis 2. pyelonephritis 3. renal infarct 
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, and renal infarct. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is correctly identified and is a highly relevant diagnosis given the context of symptoms that might suggest kidney stones.
2. Pyelonephritis is also a pertinent diagnosis and aligns well with the potential findings associated with kidney-related symptoms.
3. However, renal infarct is not included in the answer key and may not be as relevant based on the initial findings expected from the interview. This introduces a minor flaw in the prioritization and relevance of the differential diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis reflects a generally good interpretation of findings, but the inclusion of renal infarct introduces some inconsistency. The prioritization of nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis is appropriate, but the addition of renal infarct detracts from the overall accuracy.

Based on this evaluation, I would score this section as a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Kidney stones most likely diagnosis. Though patient does not have a family history of stones, this could be idiopathic, or related to his gout forming uric acid stones. Patient has classic presentation including acute onset, colicky flank pain that is severe. 2. Pyelonephritis less likely since no history of UTI, but must rule out due to location of pain and symptoms of dysuria. Patient is also afebrile making this less likely. 3. Renal infarct - could cause acute flank pain, less likely, no history of CAD or atherosclerosis
Response: The provided differential diagnosis support demonstrates a reasonable understanding of the possible conditions affecting the patient. 

1. For the diagnosis of kidney stones, the student correctly identifies it as the most likely diagnosis and supports it with the classic presentation of acute, severe, colicky flank pain. However, while they mention the patient's gout as a potential contributing factor for uric acid stones, they note the absence of a family history of stones, which could be seen as a weak link. The rationale is mostly strong, but the lack of family history could be considered a minor flaw in the completeness of the support.

2. The discussion of pyelonephritis recognizes that it is less likely due to the absence of a UTI history and the patient being afebrile. However, the assertion that it must be ruled out due to the location of pain and symptoms of dysuria is somewhat weak, as the absence of dysuria is a significant factor against this diagnosis. The rationale is appropriate but lacks some strength due to the missing link of dysuria.

3. The mention of renal infarct as a possibility is appropriate, but the reasoning lacks depth. The student notes it is less likely due to the absence of a history of CAD or atherosclerosis, which is a reasonable point, but it does not connect as strongly to the patient’s presenting symptoms.

Overall, the differential diagnosis, while mostly accurate, has some weak links and incomplete connections that could impact patient care. The reasoning is mostly appropriate but lacks some completeness and clarity in the connections made.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section a 3.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Will collect a UA to look for hematuria which would be more suggestive of stones. If positive for leukocyte esterase and nitrates will do urine culture to rule out infection. Will do CT non contrast stone protocol to look for nephrolithiasis. If stone is found will do pain control and encourage hydration. Will see patient back in 4-6 to confirm stone passage and discuss possible ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy if still symptomatic.
Response: The provided plan includes a UA, which is essential for evaluating hematuria and possible nephrolithiasis. It also suggests a CT non-contrast stone protocol, which is an acceptable test for diagnosing nephrolithiasis. The plan includes follow-up and management steps, which are appropriate. 

However, the plan does not mention a BMP or renal ultrasound, which are additional acceptable tests that could have been included to enhance the workup. There are no unnecessary tests mentioned, and the plan is reasonable and effective for the presented symptoms.

Overall, this plan demonstrates a reasonable approach with most essential tests included and no unnecessary tests.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 50 year old male who presents with 24 hours of sharp right sided pain that radiates to his back, nausea, vomiting, and dysuria with increased frequency. He reports the side and back pain as sharp and spasms every few hours. Tylenol did not help. No position seems to help. Reports pain as 2/10 when stable but 9/10 during a spasm episode. ROS: negative for constipation, diarrhea, cp, SOA PMH: Gout 2 years ago right toe (not currently taking medication) Meds: none Surg: none Hospitalizations: none Fam Hx: mom-cholecystitis with cholecystectomy, dad-DM and HTN Soc Hx: alcohol on occasion, no tobacco or drug use 
Response: In evaluating the provided history of present illness (HPI), we can analyze the key components based on the rubric criteria:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient does mention "sharp right sided pain," which is relevant but does not explicitly state "flank" pain. The pain is described as radiating to the back, which is a related detail.
  
2. **Duration**: The patient states "24 hours," which is correctly documented.

3. **Quality**: The pain is described as "sharp," which matches the rubric.

4. **Character of pain**: The patient mentions "spasms every few hours," which is somewhat aligned with "spasms OR colic every 1-2 hours," but does not match the frequency specified in the key.

5. **Severity**: The patient reports "2/10 when stable but 9/10 during a spasm episode," which does convey the severity of pain.

6. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are present, and the vomiting is described as not being bloody or bilious (though this is not explicitly stated in the provided HPI).

7. **Dysuria and urgency**: The patient reports dysuria with increased frequency, but does not explicitly mention urgency.

8. **Hematuria**: The absence of hematuria is not mentioned.

Overall, while most key information is present, there are some omissions and slight inaccuracies (e.g., the use of "right sided pain" instead of "right flank pain," the frequency of spasms, and the lack of mention of hematuria). The organization is fairly clear but could be improved with more concise documentation.

Considering these points, I would score this HPI a 3 on the rubric.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp 99.7, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, O2 sat 99% on RA General: normal appearing male in no acute distress HEENT: normocephalic, atraumatic, PERRLA, no scleral icterus, no cervical lymphadenopathy, mucous membranes moist Cardio: RRR, no lesions on chest, no edema, pedal pulses 2+ Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd/GI: BS present. No tenderness, rebound, or guarding. No masses or lesions. GU: right CVA tenderness MSK: Strength 5+ in all extremities Neuro: gait normal 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to identify how well the key components are documented:

1. **Normal vitals**: The vitals are documented and appear normal, which is good.
2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The findings include "right CVA tenderness", which aligns with the key positive finding.
3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The exam states "No tenderness, rebound, or guarding", which indicates no abdominal tenderness.

Now let's assess the organization and relevance of the information:

- The physical exam findings are quite detailed and include multiple systems (General, HEENT, Cardio, Lung, Abd/GI, GU, MSK, Neuro). 
- While the information is thorough, it does not omit any key findings and is generally well organized. 
- However, the level of detail might be seen as excessive for a concise note, especially since the rubric emphasizes being concise.

Given this evaluation, the note includes all the key findings required, is organized, but has an extensive level of detail that slightly obscures the key points.

This leads to a score of 3: Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives.

2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis/UTI
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis/UTI. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is correctly identified as it aligns with common symptoms such as severe flank pain and hematuria, which are typically associated with kidney stones. 
2. Pyelonephritis and UTI are also appropriate considerations given that these conditions can present with similar symptoms, such as dysuria or fever.

The prioritization of nephrolithiasis as the first choice is appropriate based on the typical presentation of the symptoms. Pyelonephritis/UTI is a reasonable second choice as the symptoms can overlap, but it is slightly less prioritized than nephrolithiasis in this context.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings and is prioritized correctly, with no major flaws that would impact patient care.

- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis- spasming episodic pain with CVA tenderness, dysuria, nausea/vomiting, pain not affected by position 2. Pyelonephritis- CVA tenderness with dysuria, nausea/vomiting
Response: To evaluate the provided differential diagnosis support against the rubric, we need to analyze the connections made between patient findings and the potential diagnoses.

1. **Nephrolithiasis:**
   - The support mentions "spasming episodic pain," which is somewhat aligned with the description of right flank pain being sharp and intermittent or colic. However, there is no mention of the severity of pain (9/10) or the duration (24 hours).
   - The inclusion of "CVA tenderness" is appropriate for nephrolithiasis but lacks the specific mention of the right flank pain being acute.
   - The mention of "dysuria" is not supported by the initial patient report, which did not indicate this symptom.
   - "Nausea/vomiting" is correctly linked.
   - The statement "pain not affected by position" is not relevant to nephrolithiasis.

2. **Pyelonephritis:**
   - The support states "CVA tenderness with dysuria, nausea/vomiting." This aligns well with the symptoms of pyelonephritis, but again, the absence of right flank pain in the description is a gap.

Overall, the differential diagnosis lacks some accurate links to the patient findings (e.g., missing severity and duration in nephrolithiasis, and the absence of right flank pain in pyelonephritis). The connections made are somewhat relevant, but incorrect or missing elements could lead to a misinterpretation of the patient's condition.

Given these points, I would score this section as follows:
- It has some appropriate connections but lacks completeness and accuracy in linking findings to diagnoses.

I would assign a score of 2.

I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Right abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for stone (can consider abdominal CT without contrast if not well visualized). UA to look for infection/blood. CBC to look for signs of infection.
Response: To evaluate the plan for diagnostic workup provided, we need to assess the inclusion of essential tests and the presence of unnecessary tests based on the rubric criteria.

1. **UA (Urinalysis)**: This is included and is a required test, which is good.
2. **CT abdomen/pelvis**: The plan mentions considering an abdominal CT without contrast if the ultrasound does not visualize well. This is acceptable as it falls under the category of acceptable tests.
3. **Abdominal ultrasound**: This is also acceptable for evaluating stones, and it is included.
4. **CBC (Complete Blood Count)**: This is not listed as a required or acceptable test in the answer key. However, it can be considered a reasonable test to check for signs of infection, but it does not directly align with the essential tests outlined.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and acceptable abdominal ultrasound and CT, but it includes the CBC, which is not listed in the answer key, making it somewhat unnecessary.

Thus, the plan is reasonable and includes most essential tests but includes some that are not necessary (the CBC).

Based on the rubric:
- It includes most essential tests (UA, abdominal ultrasound, CT).
- It includes one unnecessary test (CBC).

This aligns with a score of 3: "Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests."

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: cc = right flank pain hpi - crampy, sharp right flank pain with sudden onset at work while sitting on a desk 2 days ago - radiates from right flank area to right groin area - has tried ibuprofen for pain control with minimal relief; no reported aggravating factors - rated 8-9/10 at its worst and 2-3/10 at its best; he describes having episodes of pain every 20 minutes of varying intensity that last between 2-10 minutes - pain has made him nauseated and he reports 2 episodes of non-bloody emesis over the past 2 days - he denies actual pain or burning with urination, but he reports that he feels increased "pressure" upon urinating and also reports increased frequency of urination - he exercises quite often but denies any recent injuries or other recognizable inciting events - he describes no worsening of pain with food intake - denies fevers, chills, nausea, dysuria, or hematuria pmh - gout, mostly affecting toe; no episode in past 2 years psh - none medications - none allergies nkda, no environmental social history - works a desk job, no heavy lifting - on a low purine intake diet because of gout, overall eats relatively healthy - drinks about 2-3 8oz quantities of water per day - exercises frequently and is in a program at planet fitness family medial history - mom = gallstones, had cholecystectomy - dad = depression 
Response: To evaluate the provided HPI against the rubric, we need to assess the presence of key information related to the patient's right flank pain, as outlined in the answer key.

1. **Right flank pain**: The chief complaint is clearly stated as right flank pain.
2. **Duration**: The HPI mentions that the pain started 2 days ago, which is acceptable but does not specify "x24 hours or acute" as indicated in the answer key.
3. **Character of pain**: The pain is described as "crampy, sharp," which aligns with the key descriptor of "sharp" but does not mention spasms or colic.
4. **Severity**: The patient rates the pain as 8-9/10 at its worst, which is acceptable, but it does not mention the best rating, which is indicated as 2-3/10.
5. **Frequency of pain**: The patient describes episodes of pain every 20 minutes, which is somewhat different from the expected "every 1-2 hours" but still provides a sense of frequency.
6. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient reports nausea and two episodes of non-bloody emesis, which aligns with the requirement for nausea and vomiting.
7. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The HPI describes increased pressure upon urination and increased frequency, which suggests urgency but does not clearly state dysuria. The patient denies pain or burning with urination.
8. **Hematuria**: The patient denies hematuria, which is correctly documented.

Overall, the HPI captures much of the necessary information but lacks some specific details and organization as per the rubric. The key findings are mostly present, but the omissions and slight disorganization, particularly regarding the character and frequency of pain, lead to a lower score.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: vitals temp 99.7, hr 85, bp 128/82, o2 on RA 99%, rr 16 physical exam: general = sitting on exam table with hands on knees with torso slightly bent over, appears mildly uncomfortable heent = appropriate dentition for age, no posterior oropharyngeal erythema or tonsillar exudates. PERRL. EOMI. cardio = normal s1 and s2, regular rate/rhythm, no m/r/g respiratory = good air movement bilaterally no wheezing rhonchi rales GI = non-distended and non-tender throughout, no organomegaly GU = no left-sided CVA tenderness. right-sided CVA tenderness to mild palpation (percussion deferred). back = no midline tenderness to the C/T/L spine neuro = grossly non-focal. gait appropriate. upper extremity (elbow flexion, elbow extension, shoulder abduction) and lower extremity strength (hip flexion, knee flexion, knee extension) 5/5 bilaterally. 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to assess the presence and organization of key physical exam findings in relation to the answer key.

1. **Normal vitals**: The vitals provided (temp 99.7, hr 85, bp 128/82, o2 on RA 99%, rr 16) show that the patient has a slightly elevated temperature but otherwise normal readings for heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate. However, the presence of a fever (temp 99.7) indicates that the vital signs are not entirely "normal."

2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The findings indicate right-sided CVA tenderness to mild palpation, which aligns with the key finding of CVA tenderness. However, there is no mention of left-sided tenderness, which is also part of the answer key.

3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The exam states "non-tender throughout" in the GI section, which correctly indicates no abdominal tenderness.

4. **Organization and relevance**: The physical exam findings are well-organized and mostly relevant, but the details provided in sections like HEENT and neuro may contain some information that could be considered excessive or not directly related to the key findings.

Taking all this into account:
- The key findings are mostly represented, but the normality of vitals is compromised by the fever, and there is a lack of left-sided CVA tenderness.
- The organization is good, but there is some irrelevant detail that could obscure the key findings.

Based on these observations, I would score this section as a 2 because many key physical exam findings are omitted (specifically the lack of left-sided CVA tenderness and the abnormal vital sign) and the exam is somewhat detailed, obscuring the most crucial points.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Middle-aged male with history of gout (1) presenting with acute-onset (2) crampy/sharp right-sided flank pain (3) with radiation to the groin (4) and with pertinent physical exam finding of right-sided CVA tenderness to mild palpation (5). 
Response: To evaluate the provided statement against the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements based on the answer key.

1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours - Present (mentioned as "acute-onset").
2. Right flank pain - Present (described as "right-sided flank pain").
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity - Not present (the intensity is described as "crampy/sharp," but does not specify a severity level of 10/10 or severe).
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves - Not present (the description does not indicate spasms, colic, or waves).
5. Optional elements are not required but are considered for completeness. The statement does not mention non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, or afebrile.

The statement contains:
- 1 essential element (acute onset)
- 2 missing essential elements (intensity and pain characteristics)
- 1 optional finding (right-sided CVA tenderness) that does not count towards the essential elements.

According to the rubric:
- Missing multiple essential elements results in a score of 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. ureterolithiasis - acute onset sharp/crampy flank pain with CVA tenderness and, more specifically, with radiation to the groin is classically consistent with ureterolithiasis - majority of stones are calcium phosphate, however history of gout is a risk factor for stone formation (uric acid) - being middle aged, male, and having poor water intake are also risk factors 2. nephrolithiasis - same as above, however pain radiating to the groin area is more consistent with stone involving the ureter rather than kidney. 
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes "ureterolithiasis" and "nephrolithiasis." Both of these diagnoses are closely related and reflect an understanding of the patient's acute onset of sharp/crampy flank pain, CVA tenderness, and radiation of pain to the groin, which are classic symptoms of ureteral stones.

1. **Ureterolithiasis**: This diagnosis is appropriate given the symptoms described and aligns well with the findings. The explanation includes relevant risk factors, which further supports the reasoning.

2. **Nephrolithiasis**: This diagnosis is also appropriate, but it is somewhat redundant given that ureterolithiasis is a more specific diagnosis for the symptoms presented. However, it does acknowledge the possibility of a kidney stone which could be causing similar symptoms.

The differential diagnoses are generally consistent with the findings, but there is a minor flaw in prioritization since ureterolithiasis should be the primary diagnosis given the symptoms. The inclusion of nephrolithiasis is somewhat redundant but not detrimental to patient care. 

Overall, the differential diagnosis reflects a good understanding of the patient's condition, with only minor flaws in prioritization.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. ureterolithiasis - acute onset sharp/crampy flank pain with CVA tenderness and, more specifically, with radiation to the groin is classically consistent with ureterolithiasis - majority of stones are calcium phosphate, however history of gout is a risk factor for stone formation (uric acid) - being middle aged, male, and having poor water intake are also risk factors 2. nephrolithiasis - same as above, however pain radiating to the groin area is more consistent with stone involving the ureter rather than kidney.
Response: The provided support for the differential diagnosis includes two conditions: ureterolithiasis and nephrolithiasis. Both diagnoses are well-supported by the symptoms described (acute onset sharp/crampy flank pain, CVA tenderness, and radiation to the groin). Additionally, the mention of risk factors such as a history of gout, being middle-aged and male, and poor water intake strengthens the argument for nephrolithiasis.

However, the support does not mention some key aspects related to UTI/pyelonephritis, such as dysuria or urgency, nor does it address muscle strain or inguinal hernia. While the differential diagnosis is strong for ureterolithiasis and nephrolithiasis, it lacks completeness regarding other potential diagnoses that could be considered based on the patient's symptoms.

Overall, the differential diagnosis presented is appropriately supported, but it misses some links that would provide a more comprehensive view of the patient's condition. Thus, it does not negatively impact patient care significantly but could be improved.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section a 3.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. CT abdomen (stone protocol) WITHOUT IV contrast - would allow for visualization of stone and location 2. urinalysis - feel that this is necessary to definitely rule out concomitant urinary tract infection (stone + infection is a urologic emergency) - would want to see if nitrates, bacteria, or leukocyte esterase are positive
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup based on the rubric:

1. The plan includes a CT abdomen (stone protocol) without IV contrast, which is acceptable as it allows visualization of stones. However, it is important to note that while it is acceptable, it is not strictly required.
2. The plan also includes a urinalysis, which is required and necessary to rule out a urinary tract infection.

The plan does not include any unnecessary tests, and it covers the essential tests needed for the diagnosis. However, the inclusion of the CT scan, while acceptable, indicates that there may be a slight over-reliance on imaging rather than the most efficient approach, which might be considered unnecessary in some contexts.

Overall, the plan is reasonable and includes most essential tests, with no truly unnecessary tests identified. Therefore, it aligns closely with the criteria for a score of 3.

For example, the "Supporting Information" section appears to repeat information from the "Differential Diagnosis" section without adding new insights, which could lead to redundancy. Additionally, while the information is generally well-organized, there are minor instances where details could be better categorized or streamlined for clarity.

Overall, the majority of features are organized, and the information is presented in appropriate sections, but the redundancy in the "Supporting Information" section detracts from its overall organization.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI Mr. Nathanial Ryan is a 61 yo man with PMH of gout presenting with 24 hours of right flank pain. He states he was eating lunch at work as an insurance company manager yesterday with he suddenly developed right flank pain. There is continuous underlying pain, but the pain will sometimes worsen to severe pain for a few minutes. A couple times the pain has traveled down toward his groin and couple other times it has radiated toward his back. During this time, he has had nausea and two episodes of vomiting as well as urinary frequency, urgency, and occasional dysuria. He states this has never happened to him before. He mentions a few days ago he went to the gym to try out rowing, which left him with diffuse muscle soreness for a few days. Denies fever, chills, hematuria. ROS Gen- no fever, chills, HA Resp- no dyspnea CV- no chest pain, palpitations Abd- nausea, vomiting, right flank pain as described in HPI GU- urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria as described in HPI, denies hematuria MSK- recent diffuse muscle soreness following activity change PMH - Gout 2 years ago treated with medication and in remission - No allergies PSH- none Meds- no regular medications, but tried tylenol Family history Mother- gallstones Father- type 2 diabetes, HTN Social history Works as a manager at an insurance company Denies TOB use EtOH ~1x/month
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI against the scoring rubric, we can break down the key information present:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient describes the pain as occurring for 24 hours, which is acute. However, he mentions it is continuous with episodes of severe pain, which could be interpreted as not fully aligning with the sharp, spasmodic nature described in the answer key. The mention of pain radiating to the groin and back is relevant but deviates from the expected description of spasms or colic every 1-2 hours.

2. **Severity of pain**: The patient describes the pain as severe at times but does not provide a specific pain rating (e.g., 9/10), which is a key detail in the answer key.

3. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient reports nausea and two episodes of vomiting, which aligns with the answer key. However, the description of the vomiting is not specified as clear or nonbloody/nonbilious.

4. **Dysuria and urgency**: The patient reports urinary frequency, urgency, and occasional dysuria, which is consistent with the answer key. However, the absence of hematuria is correctly noted.

5. **Omitted details**: The patient does not mention the sharp nature of the pain or the specific frequency of spasms as outlined in the answer key. Additionally, the pain rating is missing.

In summary, while the HPI contains many relevant details, it lacks some critical aspects (sharp pain description, specific pain rating, and clarity regarding the nature of the vomiting). Therefore, I would score this section as a 2, as it has many key historical findings omitted and is somewhat disorganized in how the pain is described.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals temp- 99.7F HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 O2 99% on room air Gen- uncomfortable appearing, sitting up on exam table HENT- PERRL, moist mucous membranes, normal dentition and oropharynx, no LAD Resp- lungs CTAB CV- RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally Abd- right-sided costovertebral angle tenderness, no distension, TTP, normoactive bowel sounds MSK- 5/5 BUE and BLE strength Neuro- normal gait
Response: In the provided physical exam findings, the following observations can be made:

- **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are mostly normal, but the temperature is slightly elevated (99.7F), which may not be considered "normal" depending on the context. However, it is documented clearly.
- **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: This finding is documented as "right-sided costovertebral angle tenderness," which aligns with the key finding.
- **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note states "no distension, TTP," which suggests there is no tenderness to palpation (TTP) in the abdomen. However, it is unclear if "TTP" was meant to indicate tenderness in the context of the abdomen, as it could imply tenderness to palpation in other areas.

Overall, while the exam is fairly comprehensive and organized, it does contain a slight ambiguity regarding the abdominal tenderness findings. However, the key findings of costovertebral angle tenderness and the overall organization are present.

Given these observations, I would score this section as a 3, since most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but there's a slight lack of clarity regarding the pertinent negatives.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Nathanial Ryan is a 61 yo man with PMH of gout presenting to the ED with acute-onset right-sided, severe, colicky flank pain with urinary changes.
Response: To evaluate the response based on the provided rubric, let's break down the essential elements according to the answer key:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - Present (acute-onset)
2. **Right flank pain** - Present (right-sided flank pain)
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - Present (severe)
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - Present (colicky)
5. **Optional elements** - Not present (no mention of non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, or afebrile)

Now, let's count the total elements reported:
- There are 4 essential elements present.
- There are no missing essential elements, and the statement contains fewer than 5 total elements.

According to the rubric:
- Since all essential elements are present and the statement has 4 total elements (which is 5 or fewer), this fits into the criteria for a score of 4.

2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Muscle strain 3. Pyelonephritis
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided:

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: This is a correct diagnosis given the symptoms typically associated with kidney stones, such as severe pain and hematuria. It aligns well with the findings.

2. **Muscle strain**: This option is included as an optional diagnosis. While muscle strain can cause pain in the abdominal or flank region, it is less likely to be a primary concern given the context of the patient's symptoms that suggest a urinary issue. Its inclusion may reflect a broader consideration but does not prioritize the more relevant diagnoses.

3. **Pyelonephritis**: This is also a relevant diagnosis, particularly if there are signs of an infection or systemic symptoms. It is consistent with findings related to urinary tract issues.

Overall, the differential diagnosis includes the key conditions related to the symptoms described, but the inclusion of the muscle strain as a primary diagnosis detracts from the prioritization of the more relevant options. However, the overall consistency with findings is maintained.

Based on the rubric:
- The differential diagnosis is generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization due to the inclusion of the muscle strain.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis- most likely due to acute onset, severe pain with colicky course, history of gout, urinary symptoms, and CVA tenderness on exam 2. Muscle strain- possible due to history of recent increase in activity level, but less likely as it would not explain urinary symptoms or CVA tenderness 3. Pyelonephritis- possible due to urinary symptoms and CVA tenderness on exam, but patient is afebrile and would expect pain to be constant
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we will assess the accuracy and completeness of the links made between the patient findings and the proposed diagnoses.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The reasoning for this diagnosis is robust. The acute onset of severe, colicky right flank pain, the history of gout, and the mention of urinary symptoms (nausea and vomiting) align well with the characteristics of nephrolithiasis. However, the mention of "CVA tenderness" is not indicated in the original answer key for nephrolithiasis, which could lead to some confusion. Despite this, the overall reasoning is strong and well-supported.

2. **Muscle strain**: The reasoning here is appropriate. The connection to a recent increase in activity level is relevant, but the explanation notes that it does not account for urinary symptoms or CVA tenderness, which is a correct and important distinction. This shows a thoughtful consideration of the differential.

3. **Pyelonephritis**: The rationale for this diagnosis is somewhat weak. While it mentions urinary symptoms and CVA tenderness, it also states that the patient is afebrile and expects pain to be constant. This is a critical observation; however, it does not strongly link the diagnosis to the patient's acute presentation, which is more characteristic of nephrolithiasis. Thus, the reasoning lacks completeness.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported, but there are some missing or incorrect links that could affect the clarity of the reasoning, particularly concerning the nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis connections. The presence of CVA tenderness and urinary symptoms could have been better clarified.

Given the evaluation, I would score this section as a 3.

2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Pt is a middle-age male with pmh of diet-controlled gout presenting acutely with right flank pain. His examination is significant for mild suprapubic tenderness and right costovertebral pain. 
Response: To evaluate the provided note against the rubric, let's break down the essential elements and see how many are present:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The note states "presenting acutely," which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The note mentions "right flank pain," which satisfies this criterion.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The note does not specify the intensity of the pain, so this element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The note does not mention spasms, colic, or that the pain comes in waves, so this element is missing.

The optional elements are not required for scoring but may provide additional context. However, they do not affect the score directly.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Present: Acute onset, Right flank pain
- Missing: 10/10 intensity or severe intensity, Spasms or colic or pain comes in waves

Since there are two essential elements missing, the score according to the rubric would be a 2, as multiple essential elements are not present.

Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. kidney stone, nephrolithiasis 2/2 to uncontrolled gout 2. pyelonephritis 3. cystitis 2/2 urolithiasis
Response: To evaluate the provided differential diagnosis (ddx) based on the rubric, let's analyze the components:

1. The first item "kidney stone, nephrolithiasis" is correct and aligns with the expected findings, as it is a primary condition associated with renal colic. However, the mention of "uncontrolled gout" does not fit into the expected ddx for renal colic. This could indicate a minor flaw in prioritization.

2. The second item "pyelonephritis" is also consistent with the expected findings, as it is a relevant condition that can arise from a urinary tract infection.

3. The third item "cystitis" is somewhat relevant, but it is not listed in the answer key. While cystitis can be a consideration in urinary symptoms, it is less prioritized compared to the other options given the context of renal colic.

Overall, the differential diagnosis includes relevant conditions but also contains inaccuracies and less prioritized options. The inclusion of "uncontrolled gout" and "cystitis" reflects an overly broad and somewhat inaccurately prioritized ddx.

Considering these points, the score for this differential diagnosis would be a 2, as it is somewhat consistent with the findings but contains inaccuracies and broader options.

I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. hx of gout only controlled via diet, positive costovertebral tenderness, mildly febrile with t of 99.7, acute presentation of flank pain, increased urinary urge and frequency 2. pyelonephritis - possible due to presentation of costovertebral tenderness, mild fever, and increased urge and frequency. however, would expect presentation to be much worse with a higher fever, worsening uti symptoms, and history of recurrent uti 3. likely given presentation and associated symptoms of increased urge and frequency. less likely given history of flank pain
Response: To evaluate the provided support for the differential diagnosis, let's break down the information according to the rubric criteria.

1. The history of gout is relevant and contributes to the consideration of nephrolithiasis, but it is only one part of the overall clinical picture.
2. The presence of positive costovertebral tenderness, mild fever, and increased urinary urgency and frequency strongly supports a diagnosis of pyelonephritis. The reasoning that the expected presentation would be worse aligns with clinical expectations, showing a good understanding of the condition.
3. The mention of flank pain in relation to a muscle strain and inguinal hernia is noted, but the connections made to these diagnoses are weaker. The reasoning that flank pain is less likely given the history of increased urinary symptoms is somewhat confusing and doesn't clearly link back to the findings.

Overall, the differential diagnosis presented is appropriate and supported by the information provided, especially with respect to pyelonephritis. However, the links made to muscle strain and inguinal hernia are not as strong and could use more clarity.

Considering these points, I would assign a score of 3, as the differential diagnosis is appropriately supported but contains some missing or unclear links that wouldn't negatively impact patient care.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. UA and Urine culture 2. renal u/s 3. CBC, CMP for possible infection 4. will consider ct abd/pelvis if U/S unremarkable 5. recommend adequate po fluid intake 
Response: To evaluate the plan for diagnostic workup based on the provided rubric and answer key, let's analyze the components of the submitted plan:

1. **UA and Urine culture** - This is required and aligns with the answer key.
2. **Renal ultrasound** - This is acceptable and included in the plan.
3. **CBC, CMP for possible infection** - While CBC and CMP can be useful, they are not specifically mentioned in the answer key as acceptable or required tests. However, they may be relevant in a broader context for assessing infection.
4. **Will consider CT abdomen/pelvis if U/S unremarkable** - This is acceptable as it shows a thoughtful approach to further imaging based on the results of the ultrasound.
5. **Recommend adequate po fluid intake** - This is a reasonable recommendation, but it doesn't fall under the category of diagnostic tests.

Overall, the plan includes the required UA and acceptable renal ultrasound, but it also includes CBC and CMP, which are not specified as essential in the rubric. The CT abdomen/pelvis is a conditional part of the plan, which is reasonable. Thus, while the plan has some unnecessary components (CBC, CMP), it does include most of the essential tests.

Based on this analysis, the score would be a 3, as it represents a reasonable plan that includes most essential tests but also some unnecessary ones.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI: Mr. Ryan is a middle-aged male presenting to the ED with right-sided abdominal pain since yesterday morning. He reports the pain is constant and dull, with occasional episodes of sharp pain that sometimes radiates to his groin. The sharp pains have lead to nausea and vomiting twice. Tylenol has not relived his pain. He reports the sharp pain comes at random and is not worsened by any factors. He has also has 2 episodes of burning with urination, but denies any blood in his urine. He also went to the gym 3 days ago and did more rowing than usual. He denies fevers or changes in bowel habits. He has never had an episode like this before. PMH: 1 episode of gout 2 years ago that resolved with medication. No daily meds. No surgeries. Sprained ankle in high school. FH: Mother had gallstones with cholecystectomy and father had diabetes. SH: Sedentary job. Denies smoking and drugs use. Alcohol approximately 1x a month. ROS: denies changes in vision, changes in sleep, difficulties hearing, chest pain, racing heart, shortness of breath, stomach pain (other than HPI), difficulties stooling, difficulties urination (other than HPI), joint pain, abnormal rashes or bruising, depression and anxiety. 
Response: The HPI provided contains several components that need to be evaluated against the rubric.

1. **Key Information Present**: The patient reports right-sided abdominal pain, which is a critical symptom. However, the description of the pain is somewhat inconsistent with the answer key. The patient describes the pain as "constant and dull" rather than "sharp" and "spasms or colic every 1-2 hours." This is a significant deviation from the expected description of the pain.

2. **Duration**: The HPI mentions the pain started "since yesterday morning," which is consistent with the rubric's requirement for the duration of 24 hours or acute.

3. **Severity**: The patient does not quantify the severity of the pain (no mention of a pain scale like 9/10), which is a key missing detail.

4. **Associated Symptoms**: The HPI notes nausea and vomiting, which is present, but it does not specify if the vomiting was clear or nonbloody/nonbilious, which is a pertinent detail.

5. **Dysuria**: The patient reports "2 episodes of burning with urination," which indicates dysuria, and correctly denies hematuria. However, the answer key requires urgency to be documented, which is not mentioned.

6. **Overall Organization**: The HPI is somewhat organized, but the lack of key details and the inconsistency in the description of pain detracts from its clarity.

Considering all these points, the HPI has some key information but is missing significant components and contains inconsistencies that obscure the critical elements of the patient's history. 

Based on the rubric, this HPI would likely fall into the "2" category due to the omission of many key historical findings and the disorganization in describing the pain.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Temp 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 Oxygen 99% on RA Constitutional: Awake, alert, and oriented x3. HEENT: EOM intact. PERRL. Neck: No lymphadenopathy. CV: Normal s1 and s2. No murmurs appreciated. No lower extremity edema. Posterior tibial pulses 2+. Lungs: clear to ascultation bilaterally. Abdomen: No point tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds present. CVA tenderness to palpation at right flank. Neuro: UE strength 5/5 b/l. LE strength 5/5 b/l. Normal gait. MSK: no tenderness to palpation of thoracic or lumbar spine or paraspinal muscles. Normal range of motion of lumbar spine. 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we need to identify the presence of key findings and their organization. 

1. **Key Findings Present**: The note includes normal vital signs, which is a key finding. It also documents positive costovertebral angle tenderness (CVA tenderness at the right flank), which is another key finding. Additionally, it notes the absence of abdominal tenderness, which is a pertinent negative finding.

2. **Conciseness and Organization**: The findings are well-organized under appropriate headings (Constitutional, HEENT, CV, etc.), making it easy to follow. The information is concise and relevant to the patient's presentation.

3. **Missing Findings**: While the note includes most of the key findings, it does not explicitly document the normal findings for abdominal tenderness in a way that emphasizes the negative aspect. However, the absence of abdominal tenderness is mentioned, which helps to address this.

4. **Irrelevant Information**: There does not appear to be irrelevant information included in the note; all details seem pertinent to the patient's symptoms and presentation.

Based on this assessment, the note captures almost all key physical exam findings in a concise and organized manner, with little irrelevant information. Thus, it aligns closely with the criteria for a score of 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle-aged male presenting with 1 day of colicky right flank pain with radiation to his groin and associated dysuria. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement against the rubric, let's identify the essential elements from the answer key:

1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours: The statement mentions "1 day," which indicates acute onset.
2. Right flank pain: The statement specifies "right flank pain."
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity: The statement does not specify the intensity of the pain.
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves: The statement uses "colicky," which fulfills this requirement.
5. Optional elements: The statement includes "radiation to his groin" and "associated dysuria," but does not include any of the optional elements listed in the answer key.

Now, let's assess the summary:
- It includes 3 essential elements (acute onset, right flank pain, and colicky nature of the pain).
- It is missing 1 essential element (the intensity of the pain).
- The total number of elements present is 3 essential + 2 optional = 5 total elements.

According to the rubric:
- The statement is missing 1 essential element and has 5 total elements.

Thus, the score for this summary statement is 3.

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1.) Nephrolithiasis 2.) Lumbar strain
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes "Nephrolithiasis" and "Lumbar strain." 

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: This aligns well with the likely symptoms of renal colic, given the context of kidney stones, which is consistent with the findings of a patient experiencing severe pain in the back or flank area.

2. **Lumbar strain**: This is less relevant as a primary diagnosis when considering the symptoms typically associated with nephrolithiasis. While it may be a possible contributing factor to back pain, it does not directly correlate with urinary symptoms or the acute nature of renal colic.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the findings but includes an option (lumbar strain) that is less relevant to the primary concern and does not prioritize the most critical conditions effectively. Therefore, it is overly broad and inaccurately prioritized.

Based on the rubric, I would score this as a 2.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting

- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1.) Nephrolithiasis - this is most likely diagnosis given the nature of the symptoms. Colicky right flank pain with radiation to his groin with associated dysuria. This is supported by his previous episode of gout, which indicates that he could have difficulties with oxalate excretion. However, his recent history of rowing supports the alternative diagnosis. 2.) Lumbar strain - he has a sedentary lifestyle and recently did significantly more exercise than usual specifically targeting his back muscles (rowing). However, I would expect this pain to worsen with movement instead of at random. I would also no expect this to cause dysuria. 
Response: In evaluating the provided differential diagnosis support, we can break down the reasoning as follows:

1. **Nephrolithiasis**: The student identifies nephrolithiasis as the most likely diagnosis, which aligns with the key symptoms of colicky right flank pain and dysuria. The mention of a previous episode of gout is relevant, as it suggests a predisposition to kidney stones due to possible issues with oxalate metabolism. However, the student mentions that the recent history of rowing supports an alternative diagnosis, which is a somewhat weak link since it does not directly relate to nephrolithiasis but rather to muscle strain.

2. **Lumbar strain**: The student discusses the lumbar strain, noting the recent increase in exercise. Although this could be a plausible diagnosis, the reasoning provided lacks a strong connection to the symptoms of dysuria, which is typically not associated with muscle strain. The expectation that pain would worsen with movement is a good observation but does not strengthen the link to lumbar strain given the symptom of dysuria.

Overall, the student provides a reasonable differential diagnosis but lacks complete support for the links between findings and diagnoses, particularly for lumbar strain. The connection to nephrolithiasis is stronger, but the mention of rowing as a potential alternative diagnosis introduces some confusion.

Given these considerations, I would rate this section as a 2, indicating a weakly supported differential diagnosis with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Abdominal CT scan
Response: The provided plan includes only an abdominal CT scan. According to the answer key, while a CT abdomen/pelvis is an acceptable test, the plan lacks the essential test, which is a urinalysis (UA). Additionally, there are no other tests, such as BMP or renal ultrasound, included in the plan. Therefore, it misses essential tests and does not provide a comprehensive or effective workup.

Based on the rubric:
- The plan is ineffective as it misses essential tests (UA) and includes only one acceptable test (CT abdomen/pelvis).
- Since it does not include any irrelevant tests or unnecessary tests, it does not fall into the lowest scoring category.

Thus, the appropriate score for this plan is 2.

Plan:
Abdominal CT scan


Response: The organization of the note is generally clear and follows a logical structure, with distinct sections for History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section contains relevant information that pertains to the patient's presentation and symptoms. 

However, there are a couple of minor issues:
1. In the HPI, the information flows well but could be slightly more concise to enhance clarity.
2. The Summary section reiterates information already provided in the HPI, which could be avoided for better organization.

Overall, the note is mostly organized, with all features present and the information largely in appropriate sections, but there are minor issues with redundancy and conciseness.

Based on these observations, I would assign a score of 3.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 60 year old male who presents to the ED with a chief complaint of 1 day of right sided flank pain. Mr. Ryan reports that these symptoms started yesterday which he describes as right side pain that travels down his groin. He states that he maintains a baseline level of pain, but that approximately every 1-2 hours, he will have a "spasm" where the pain will intensify and it will last for 2-20 minutes. He reports that during the past day, he has also had pain with urination and increased urinary frequency. He reports that the pain is so intense that he will have nausea and vomiting with the spasms. He reports that this has never happened before. He tried taking Tylenol, but reports that it did not alleviate his symptoms. A 14-point review of systems was performed. Pertinent positives include right-sided flank pain, dysuria, nausea, and vomiting. Pertinent negatives include fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, hematuria, headache, lightheadedness. He has no chronic medical conditions. He reports that 2 years ago he had an episode of gout that was treated and has not recurred. He takes no medications daily. He has no allergies. He has no history of surgeries. Family history is notable for gallstones in his mother. He does not endorse the use of tobacco products, alcohol, or other drugs. He reports no new sexual partners. 
Response: In evaluating the provided history of present illness (HPI) for Nathaniel Ryan, we can identify the following key components based on the rubric:

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient correctly identifies the location of the pain as right-sided flank pain.
2. **Duration**: The patient mentions that the symptoms started "yesterday," which indicates a duration of approximately 24 hours.
3. **Character of pain**: The patient describes the pain as "sharp" and experiences "spasms" every 1-2 hours, which aligns with the rubric's expectations.
4. **Severity**: The patient states that the pain is "so intense" that it causes nausea and vomiting, but does not quantify the pain on a scale (e.g., 9/10), which is a minor omission.
5. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are documented, and the type of vomiting is described as "clear or nonbloody/nonbilious," although this specific detail is not explicitly stated.
6. **Dysuria and urgency**: The patient reports pain with urination and increased urinary frequency, which aligns with dysuria.
7. **Hematuria**: The patient explicitly states "no hematuria," which is an important pertinent negative.

Overall, the HPI is well-organized and includes most of the key information. However, it does miss the explicit mention of pain severity on a scale and does not clarify the nature of the vomiting as nonbloody/nonbilious. These omissions prevent it from receiving a perfect score.

Based on the rubric, I would score this HPI as follows:
- It contains almost all key information but lacks some minor details that would enhance clarity and completeness.

Thus, I would assign a score of 3 to this HPI.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: T 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 O2 99% on RA GEN: Well-appearing male of stated age. He looks uncomfortable on exam. He is alert and oriented. Eyes: PERRLA, EOM intact. Conjunctiva no injected. No scleral icterus. HENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic head. Mucus membranes moist. No dental abnormalities appreciated. No palpable cervical lymph nodes. Resp: No acute respiratory distress. No tachypnea. Breath sounds even bilaterally. No restricted air movement. No nasal flairing or retractions. Cardio: Heart sounds auscultated x4. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No extra heart sounds. Distal pulses 2+, no peripheral edema. Abd: Soft, non-distended, nontender to light and deep palpation. Liver not palpable on exam. No dullness to percussion. Bowel sounds appreciated. Back: No spinal tenderness. No paraspinal tenderness. Right-sided CVAT present, absent on left. Neuro: BUE, BLE 5/5 strength. Gait normal. Awake, alert, and oriented. 
Response: In this physical exam note, the student has included a comprehensive list of findings. The vital signs are normal, and the general appearance of the patient is documented. Most of the systems are examined, and findings are presented in a clear and organized manner. However, there are some key points to consider:

1. **Key Positive Findings**: The note includes positive costovertebral angle tenderness (CVAT), which is relevant to the patient's symptoms.
2. **Pertinent Negatives**: The note mentions no abdominal tenderness, which is a pertinent negative finding. However, while many systems are examined, some pertinent negatives could be inferred as missing, such as explicitly stating the absence of certain findings in the neurological exam (e.g., no focal deficits).
3. **Organization and Relevance**: The information is generally well organized and concise, with little irrelevant information. 

Overall, while the note is strong and includes many key findings, the omission of some pertinent negatives in certain areas affects the completeness of the physical exam documentation.

Given these considerations, I would score this section as a 3, as it documents most key positive findings well but lacks some pertinent negatives.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Nathaniel Ryan is a 60 year old male who presents today with 1 day of right-sided flank pain and dysuria with right-sided CVAT noted on exam. 
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement based on the rubric:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "1 day of right-sided flank pain," which indicates acute onset.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement specifies "right-sided flank pain," which meets this criterion.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not mentioned in the statement.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: This information is also not included in the statement.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement mentions dysuria, but does not include non-bilious vomiting, right groin pain, or afebrile.

Based on this analysis:
- The statement has 2 essential elements present (acute onset and right flank pain).
- It is missing 2 essential elements (intensity and description of pain).
- The statement does not exceed 5 total elements, as it primarily focuses on the essential elements.

According to the rubric, since it is missing multiple essential elements, the score would be a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Right nephrolithiasis 2. Urinary tract infection
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes "Right nephrolithiasis" and "Urinary tract infection." 

1. "Right nephrolithiasis" aligns well with the findings typically associated with kidney stones, such as severe flank pain, hematuria, or renal colic. This indicates a correct interpretation of the findings.
2. "Urinary tract infection" is also a relevant consideration, as it can present with symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, and urgency, which may overlap with kidney stone symptoms.

The differential diagnosis is pertinent and prioritized correctly, as nephrolithiasis is a likely primary concern given the context of the symptoms, followed by a UTI, which is a common secondary consideration.

Thus, the differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings and appropriately prioritized, leading to a score of 4.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Right nephrolithiasis - Supports: Unilateral flank pain with radiation to the groin, pain intense enough to elicit nausea and vomiting, dysuria - Absence of hematuria 2. Urinary tract infection - Supports: Dysuria with no gross hematuria - Refutes: Unilateral nature, location of pain, quality of the pain, lack of system symptoms like fever. 
Response: In evaluating the differential diagnosis provided:

1. **Right nephrolithiasis**: The student correctly identifies unilateral flank pain, which is consistent with nephrolithiasis. They note the intensity of the pain leading to nausea and vomiting, which supports this diagnosis. However, the mention of dysuria is not typically associated with nephrolithiasis, and the absence of hematuria is also a notable point that detracts from the strength of this link. The overall support is somewhat mixed, but the core elements align with nephrolithiasis.

2. **Urinary tract infection (UTI)**: The student acknowledges dysuria, which is a common symptom of UTI. However, they correctly refute the diagnosis based on the unilateral nature of the pain, the quality of the pain, and the absence of systemic symptoms like fever. This shows a reasonable understanding of the differential diagnosis process.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is somewhat supported, but there are several incorrect links, particularly with the nephrolithiasis diagnosis due to the misinterpretation of symptoms (dysuria and absence of hematuria). The UTI diagnosis is appropriately refuted, indicating a good understanding of the clinical picture. 

Given these considerations, I would rate this response as a 2: Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: Initial workup I would like to complete include a U/A to assess for hematuria, leukocytes, and nitrites which will help in establishing a diagnosis of either nephrolithiasis or UTI. I would like to do a right renal US to evaluate for stones. While patient remains in the ED, I would like to start him on fluids to help with hydration, which can help pass a stone. I would also like to start oxycodone prn for pain while workup is being completed. 
Response: The plan includes a urinalysis (UA), which is essential for assessing potential diagnoses of nephrolithiasis or UTI. The inclusion of a right renal ultrasound is also appropriate for evaluating stones, which is an acceptable test. The plan to start fluids for hydration and oxycodone for pain management demonstrates a reasonable approach to the patient's care.

The plan does not include any unnecessary tests and focuses on essential evaluations. Therefore, it meets the criteria for an effective and efficient diagnostic workup.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 49 year old male with a history of gout who presents with 24 hours of intermittent right sided flank pain. Patient stated that his pain has been sharp and associated with a couple episodes of emesis, and he states that it occasionally radiates to his groin. Patient has tried ibuprofen for pain, but it has not helped and he has been unable to identify any other alleviating factors. There are no aggravating factors, as patient states pain comes on randomly. Patient noted that he has recently had increased urinary urgency, but has not noticed any gross hematuria. Patient has never had symptoms like this before, but states that he is worried about gallstones because his mother had to have her gallbladder removed. Patient denied fever and chills. ROS negative except as noted in HPI PMH: gout treated with diet Medications: none Family history: mother with gallstones Surgical History: tonsillectomy as a child Social: lives in Georgetown with his wife, works outside the home. Denies alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. 
Response: The provided history of present illness (HPI) includes several key elements, but it also has some gaps in critical information. 

1. **Right flank pain**: The note correctly identifies the location (right flank) and duration (24 hours).
2. **Pain characteristics**: It mentions that the pain is sharp, but it does not specify the severity (9/10 pain is missing).
3. **Pain pattern**: The note indicates that the pain is intermittent, which is a good detail, but it does not mention spasms or colic occurring every 1-2 hours, which is part of the expected information.
4. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient reports episodes of emesis, but it does not specify whether the emesis is clear, nonbloody, or nonbilious, which is an important detail.
5. **Dysuria and urgency**: The patient notes increased urinary urgency and denies hematuria, which is documented correctly.

Overall, while the HPI captures several key aspects of the patient's symptoms, it misses some critical details such as the severity of the pain, the specific nature of the emesis, and the absence of spasms or colic. Thus, while most of the key findings are present and organized, the omissions affect the completeness and clarity of the documentation.

Based on the rubric, I would score this section as a 2, as many key historical findings are omitted and the history is somewhat disorganized.

Response: The provided physical exam findings include a comprehensive assessment of the patient's vital signs and various systems. 

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vital signs are documented clearly and indicate normal findings.
2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: This finding is noted, which is crucial for assessing renal issues.
3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: While the abdomen is described as soft and non-tender, the specific mention of "no abdominal tenderness" is absent, which is a key negative finding.

Overall, the physical exam findings are well-organized and include most of the key positive findings. However, the omission of the explicit mention of "no abdominal tenderness" is significant. Thus, the documentation is strong but lacks one pertinent negative.

Based on the rubric:
- Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives.

I would score this section a 3.

Response: To evaluate the provided sum against the rubric and answer key, we need to identify the essential elements present in the statement:

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - Present (24 hours)
2. **Right flank pain** - Present (right-sided flank pain)
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - Not explicitly stated (intensity not mentioned)
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - Not explicitly stated (pain description does not indicate spasms or colic)
5. **Optional elements** - Not mentioned, but this is not necessary for the grading.

Now, let's count the essential elements:
- Present: 2 (acute onset and right flank pain)
- Missing: 2 (intensity and description of pain)

Based on the rubric:
- They are missing multiple essential elements (specifically, the intensity and the nature of the pain).

Thus, the score for this sum is:

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2: Pyelonephritis 
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is correctly identified as a primary concern given the symptoms typically associated with kidney stones, such as severe flank pain, hematuria, and urinary changes. This aligns well with the expected findings.
2. Pyelonephritis is also a reasonable differential diagnosis, particularly if there are accompanying symptoms such as fever, chills, and urinary symptoms, which could indicate an infection that may arise from a stone.

However, the prioritization appears to be flawed. While nephrolithiasis is appropriately identified, the second diagnosis (pyelonephritis) is not as clearly prioritized based on the information provided. The absence of additional relevant symptoms or findings to support this prioritization suggests that the differential may not fully reflect the most critical concerns based on the patient's presentation.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is somewhat consistent with findings but lacks the necessary prioritization and could be considered somewhat broad, as it does not include other potential diagnoses such as muscle strain or inguinal hernia, which could also be relevant.

Thus, I would score this section as a 2.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1: Nephrolithiasis is the most likely diagnosis due to the presence of unilateral flank pain which is intermittent and sharp in nature and associated with recent onset of urinary urgency. There is also radiation to the groin which is consistent with nephrolithiasis. Patient exhibited exquisite right sided costovertebral angle tenderness which also supports this diagnosis, but could also be secondary to pyelonephritis. 2: pyelonephritis: this is possible due to presence of severe costovertebral angle tenderness on exam and recent onset of urinary urgency, however I would also expect more urinary symptoms and presence of fever or chills which this patient did not have. 
Response: The student's differential diagnosis provides a well-supported rationale for nephrolithiasis as the primary diagnosis. They correctly identify key symptoms such as unilateral flank pain, the intermittent and sharp nature of the pain, and the radiation to the groin, all of which align with nephrolithiasis. They also mention the costovertebral angle tenderness, which strengthens the case for nephrolithiasis and acknowledges the possibility of pyelonephritis. 

However, while the differential diagnosis for pyelonephritis is mentioned, the student notes the absence of urinary symptoms and fever or chills, which are important indicators for confirming that diagnosis. The explanation for muscle strain and inguinal hernia is missing, which could have provided a more comprehensive differential diagnosis.

Overall, the student's reasoning is strong but lacks some completeness in addressing all potential diagnoses. The links to nephrolithiasis are correct and well-supported, while the links to pyelonephritis are appropriately supported but not definitive. The absence of consideration for muscle strain and inguinal hernia weakens the overall differential diagnosis.

Given this analysis, I would score this section as a 3, as it is appropriately supported with missing links that would not negatively impact patient care.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score:  -@non-@contrast CT abdomen and pelvis -@CBC -@CMP -@urinalysis and urine culture
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup:

1. Required tests: The plan includes a urinalysis (UA), which is essential.
2. Acceptable tests: The plan includes a CT abdomen/pelvis, which is acceptable. However, it also includes a CBC (Complete Blood Count) and a CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel), which are not mentioned as acceptable or required in the rubric. 
3. Unacceptable tests: There are no unacceptable tests included in the plan.

The presence of the CBC and CMP, which are unnecessary based on the rubric, suggests that while the plan includes some essential tests, it also includes some unnecessary ones. Therefore, the plan is reasonable but not entirely efficient.

Based on this evaluation, the score for the plan for diagnostic workup is:

2) Some features are disorganized with information in the incorrect place or repeated and/or occasional sections missing.
1) Most features are disorganized, with appropriate sections missing.. Here is the answer key for org: . Please evaluate the following org and provide a score: History of Present Illness:
Mr. Ryan is a 49 year old male with a history of gout who presents with 24 hours of intermittent right sided flank pain. Patient stated that his pain has been sharp and associated with a couple episodes of emesis, and he states that it occasionally radiates to his groin. Patient has tried ibuprofen for pain, but it has not helped and he has been unable to identify any other alleviating factors. There are no aggravating factors, as patient states pain comes on randomly. Patient noted that he has recently had increased urinary urgency, but has not noticed any gross hematuria. Patient has never had symptoms like this before, but states that he is worried about gallstones because his mother had to have her gallbladder removed. Patient denied fever and chills. ROS negative except as noted in HPI PMH: gout treated with diet Medications: none Family history: mother with gallstones Surgical History: tonsillectomy as a child Social: lives in Georgetown with his wife, works outside the home. Denies alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. 

Physical Examination:
Vital signs: BP 128/82, HR 85, RR 16, O2 99% on RA, T 99.7 General: normal appearing male in no acute distress, well developed and well nourished HEENT: dentition normal. Mucus membranes moist. No lesions in oropharynx. Neck: no cervical lymphadenopathy CV: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs noted. No lower extremity edema. Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ and symmetric Resp: lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no respiratory distress or accessory muscle use GI: abdomen soft, non-tender, nondistended. No hernias noted. Bowel sounds present. GU: Right sided costovertebral angle tenderness present Neuro: EOM intact. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. 5/5 strength in bilateral proximal and distal upper and lower extremities. Gait normal. 

Summary:
Mr. Ryan is a 49 year old male with a history of gout who presents with 24 hours of right sided flank pain which radiates to the groin and with associated CVAT. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Nephrolithiasis 2: Pyelonephritis 

Supporting Information:
1: Nephrolithiasis is the most likely diagnosis due to the presence of unilateral flank pain which is intermittent and sharp in nature and associated with recent onset of urinary urgency. There is also radiation to the groin which is consistent with nephrolithiasis. Patient exhibited exquisite right sided costovertebral angle tenderness which also supports this diagnosis, but could also be secondary to pyelonephritis. 2: pyelonephritis: this is possible due to presence of severe costovertebral angle tenderness on exam and recent onset of urinary urgency, however I would also expect more urinary symptoms and presence of fever or chills which this patient did not have. 

Plan:
 -@non-@contrast CT abdomen and pelvis -@CBC -@CMP -@urinalysis and urine culture


Response: The organization of the provided note is generally clear and follows a logical structure. Each section is appropriately labeled, and the information is presented in a way that is easy to follow. 

1. **History of Present Illness (HPI)**: This section is well-organized and contains relevant details about the patient's symptoms, associated factors, and concerns. 
2. **Physical Examination**: The examination findings are clearly laid out with appropriate headings for each body system, making it easy to locate specific information.
3. **Summary**: The summary succinctly captures the key points from the HPI, which is helpful for quick reference.
4. **Differential Diagnosis**: This section is clearly labeled and provides a logical reasoning for the differential diagnoses based on the information presented.
5. **Supporting Information**: This section elaborates on the differential diagnoses and provides a rationale, which is helpful for understanding the clinical reasoning.
6. **Plan**: The plan is clearly outlined, although the formatting with "@" symbols is unconventional and could be seen as disorganized.

Overall, while there is a small formatting issue in the plan section, the majority of the note is well-organized and appropriately structured. Therefore, I would assign a score of 3 for this section, as most features are organized with information presented in appropriate sections, even if there are minor issues.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: R flank pain that began yesterday. Intermittent pain that comes and goes, radiates toward groin. He describes it as spasms. Associated with Urgency and burning when urinating. Also associated with nausea and vomiting. Has tried Tylenol without relief. Nothing makes the pain better or worse Rates pain as 9/10 at its worse. Patient is worried about gallstones as mother has a history. ROS: No Fever, chills, constipation, diarrhea, change in appetite PMH: Gout flare 2 years ago PSH: none FH: Mom - cholecystitis with cholecystectomy Dad- Diabetes, HTN SH: Denies smoking, drug use, drinks 1x per month Meds: none Allergies: None
Response: In evaluating the provided history of present illness (HPI) against the rubric criteria, we can assess the key components as follows:

1. **Right flank pain**: The student correctly identifies the location of the pain as "R flank pain."
2. **Duration**: The pain is noted to have begun "yesterday," which indicates an acute onset but does not explicitly state "x24 hours."
3. **Character of pain**: The student describes the pain as "intermittent" and "spasms," which aligns with the requirement for sharp pain and colic/spasms.
4. **Severity**: The student rates the pain as "9/10 at its worst," which meets the criteria for severe pain.
5. **Associated symptoms**: The student mentions "nausea and vomiting," which is consistent with the rubric. However, it does not specify if the vomiting is clear or nonbloody/nonbilious.
6. **Dysuria and urgency**: The student notes "urgency and burning when urinating," which indicates dysuria but does not explicitly mention urgency as a separate point. 
7. **Pertinent negatives**: The student fails to mention the absence of hematuria, which is a key negative finding.

Overall, the HPI includes most of the key information but lacks some specificity and pertinent negatives, particularly regarding the description of vomiting and hematuria. The organization is relatively clear, but the omission of certain details affects the completeness of the documentation.

Based on these observations, I would assign a score of 3, as most key positive historical findings are documented and organized, but there are some missing pertinent negatives.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp: 99.7 HR: 85 RR: 16 BP: 128/82 O2: 99% on RA Moist mucus membranes, no lesions in mouth, good dentition Lymph: No cervical lymphadenopathy Resp: CTAB Cardio: RRR, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops, no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulse Abd: No lesions, bruising or rashes, bowel sounds present, No pain to palpation, negative murphy sign GU: Costovertebral angle significantly tender on percussion Neuro: PERRL, EOMI, 5/5 UE and LE strength, gait normal 
Response: To evaluate the physical exam findings based on the provided answer key, I will assess the components as follows:

1. **Normal vitals**: The vitals provided are within normal limits, but the temperature is slightly elevated (99.7°F). This indicates that the vitals are not completely normal, which could be considered a negative finding.

2. **Positive costovertebral angle tenderness**: The provided findings state "Costovertebral angle significantly tender on percussion," which is consistent with the key.

3. **No abdominal tenderness**: The note states "No pain to palpation," which meets the requirement for no abdominal tenderness.

4. **Organization and relevance**: The physical exam findings are generally well organized and include relevant information. However, the detail about "no lesions, bruising or rashes" in the abdomen could be considered excessive and somewhat irrelevant given the context of the abdominal exam.

Overall, while the note includes significant findings, it also has a minor issue with the temperature and includes some irrelevant details. The key positive findings are documented, but there is a lack of some pertinent negatives. Thus, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 4.

Based on this analysis, the score for this physical exam section is:

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Nathaniel Ryan is a 40 yo male with a history of gout who presents for acute onset intermittent R flank pain that radiates toward to groin that is associated nausea, vomiting and burning and urgency when urinating. 
Response: To evaluate Nathaniel Ryan's summary statement based on the rubric provided, we need to identify the essential elements present in his statement and compare them to the answer key.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - Present (acute onset)
2. **Right flank pain** - Present (R flank pain)
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - Not explicitly stated (no intensity level given)
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - Not explicitly stated (intermittent pain mentioned, but not in the terms listed)
5. **Optional: Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile** - Present (nausea and vomiting mentioned)

Now, let's count the total elements present:
- Essential elements: 2 present (acute onset, right flank pain)
- Missing essential elements: 2 (intensity, spasms/colic)
- Optional elements: 1 present (nausea/vomiting)

The summary statement has 5 total elements, but it is missing multiple essential elements. According to the rubric:

- Since there are multiple essential elements missing, the score would be a 2.

Final score: 2

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis, which are both relevant to the symptoms typically associated with renal issues. The prioritization appears appropriate, as nephrolithiasis is often considered first in cases of acute flank pain and hematuria, while pyelonephritis is a serious condition that could arise from a UTI and is also consistent with the findings. 

There are no minor flaws in the prioritization, and both conditions are relevant to the information gathered from the patient interview. The absence of additional, less relevant options (like muscle strain or inguinal hernia) shows a focused approach.

Given these considerations, this differential diagnosis reflects a correct interpretation of the findings.

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis - spasming R flank pain that comes and goes, associated with burning and urgency when urinating, also associated with nausea and vomiting, patient has history of gout, costovertebral angle tenderness 2. Pyelonephritis - costovertebral angle tenderness, burning and urgency when urinating, but does not have fever or chills so I do not have a high suspicion for kidney infection 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided by the student, we will analyze the links made to the patient findings based on the rubric criteria.

1. **Nephrolithiasis:**
   - The student identifies "spasming R flank pain that comes and goes," which aligns with the acute, sharp, and intermittent nature of the pain described in the answer key.
   - The mention of "burning and urgency when urinating" indicates a possible link to nephrolithiasis, although urgency is more commonly associated with UTI/pyelonephritis.
   - The inclusion of "nausea and vomiting" is consistent with nephrolithiasis.
   - The patient's history of gout is relevant and supports the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, as gout can be associated with kidney stones.
   - However, the mention of costovertebral angle tenderness is more indicative of pyelonephritis, which could confuse the linkage to nephrolithiasis.

2. **Pyelonephritis:**
   - The student correctly notes "costovertebral angle tenderness," which is a strong indicator of pyelonephritis.
   - The mention of "burning and urgency when urinating" is appropriate for pyelonephritis.
   - The student acknowledges the absence of fever or chills, which is important for assessing the likelihood of a kidney infection. This demonstrates critical thinking regarding the diagnosis.
   - However, the student does not mention dysuria or urgency, which are typical symptoms of UTI/pyelonephritis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis for nephrolithiasis is somewhat supported but contains some ambiguity due to the incorrect linking of urgency and costovertebral angle tenderness. The pyelonephritis diagnosis is more appropriately supported but lacks some key symptoms.

Given these considerations, I would rate this section as follows:
- The student has made an effort to link the symptoms to the correct diagnoses, but there are some inaccuracies and unclear connections that could potentially impact patient care.

Thus, I would assign a score of 3 for this section.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CBC UA Urine culture CT scan of abdomen and ureters 
Response: To evaluate the provided plan against the rubric, we need to assess whether it includes essential tests, unnecessary tests, and if it aligns with the appropriate diagnostic workup.

1. **Essential Tests**: The rubric specifies that a Urinalysis (UA) is required. The provided plan includes a UA, which is essential.

2. **Acceptable Tests**: The answer key lists CT abdomen/pelvis and BMP as acceptable tests. The provided plan includes a CT scan of the abdomen and ureters, which is acceptable.

3. **Unacceptable Tests**: The answer key indicates that endoscopy is unacceptable. The provided plan does not include any unacceptable tests.

Now, let’s assess the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the plan:
- The plan includes the required UA and an acceptable CT scan.
- However, it does not include a BMP or renal ultrasound, which are also acceptable.
- There is no indication of unnecessary tests, as the only tests listed are either required or acceptable.

Given that the plan includes the essential test (UA) and one acceptable test (CT scan) but misses out on other acceptable tests, it does not fully meet the criteria for a plan that includes all essential tests without unnecessary tests. It is a reasonable plan but not fully comprehensive.

Thus, the plan would be scored as follows: it includes most essential tests but misses some acceptable ones, making it a reasonable plan but with some unnecessary gaps.

Final score: 3

Summary:
Nathaniel Ryan is a 40 yo male with a history of gout who presents for acute onset intermittent R flank pain that radiates toward to groin that is associated nausea, vomiting and burning and urgency when urinating. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis

Supporting Information:
1. Nephrolithiasis - spasming R flank pain that comes and goes, associated with burning and urgency when urinating, also associated with nausea and vomiting, patient has history of gout, costovertebral angle tenderness 2. Pyelonephritis - costovertebral angle tenderness, burning and urgency when urinating, but does not have fever or chills so I do not have a high suspicion for kidney infection 

Plan:
CBC UA Urine culture CT scan of abdomen and ureters 


Response: The organization of the provided note is generally clear and follows a structured format. Each section is appropriately labeled, which helps in understanding the flow of information. 

- The **History of Present Illness (HPI)** is detailed and presents the symptoms in a logical order, covering the necessary aspects of the patient's condition.
- The **Physical Examination** section is well-organized, presenting vital signs followed by findings in a systematic manner (general, lymphatic, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal, genitourinary, and neurological).
- The **Summary** succinctly encapsulates the patient's main complaint and relevant history.
- The **Differential Diagnosis** is clearly stated with supporting information that logically connects to the patient's symptoms.
- The **Plan** is straightforward and outlines the next steps in the patient's evaluation.

Overall, all features are organized, with information presented in appropriate sections, and there are no apparent issues with repetition or missing sections.

Based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 4.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 63 yo M who presents with right flank pain. The pain started 1 day ago and comes in sharp bursts and is 9/10 severe pain at its worst. The pain radiates down to his groin and is associated with frequency and dysuria. He has felt quite nauseous during the pain episodes and has vomited twice. The patient denies diet changes, belly pain, chest pain, SOA, constipation, diarrhea, fevers, or chills. He recently went to the gym for the first time in a while and used the rowing machine. ROS: reviewed and negative except for as noted in the HPI PMH: Gout two years ago PSH: None Meds: None Allergies: NKDA FH: Mother had gallstones SH: Works insurance in the office. Not physically active. Diet ok. No tobacco, Drinks alcohol twice a month. No recreational drugs
Response: In evaluating the provided HPI for Mr. Ryan against the rubric, I will assess the key components of the history of present illness (HPI) based on the answer key.

1. **Right flank pain**: The patient clearly states he has right flank pain.
2. **Duration**: The pain started 1 day ago, which is consistent with the acute nature required.
3. **Character of pain**: The pain is described as sharp, which matches the answer key.
4. **Pain pattern**: The note mentions the pain comes in sharp bursts, but it does not explicitly state the presence of spasms or colic every 1-2 hours, which is a missing detail.
5. **Severity**: The patient rates the pain as 9/10, which is correctly documented.
6. **Associated symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting are documented, with vomiting described as occurring twice and being clear/nonbloody/nonbilious, which aligns with the answer key.
7. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The note mentions frequency and dysuria, which is appropriate.
8. **Hematuria**: The patient denies hematuria, which is a pertinent negative that is included.

Overall, the HPI captures most of the key information, but it is missing the specific detail regarding spasms or colic every 1-2 hours. The organization is generally clear, but the omission of this detail affects the overall completeness of the history.

Based on the rubric:
- The information is mostly present and organized but missing one key aspect (the spasms/colic).
- Therefore, the score would fall between a 2 and 3.

Considering the overall documentation is mostly accurate and organized but with a significant omission, I would assign a score of:

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key physical exam findings are present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: T 99.7 HR 85 RR 16 BP 128/82 O2 99% on RA General: A well appearing middle aged man sitting upright on exam table HENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, PERRL, EOMI, moist mucous membranes Lungs: CTAB Heart: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, gallops, no peripheral edema, peripheral pulses 2+ throughout Abdominal: + Costovertebal angle tenderness on the right side, + bowel sounds, no abdominal tenderness, no suprapubic tenderness Skin: Warm, well perfused, capillary refill < 3 seconds Neuro: 5/5 strength upper and lower extremities bilaterally, no gait abnormalities 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, let's break down the key elements:

1. **Normal Vitals**: The vitals provided are mostly normal, except for a slight fever (T 99.7), which could be considered a minor deviation from "normal." However, the other vitals (HR, RR, BP, O2) are normal.

2. **Positive Costovertebral Angle Tenderness**: This is documented as present on the right side, which matches the answer key.

3. **No Abdominal Tenderness**: The note clearly states "no abdominal tenderness," which aligns with the answer key.

4. **Organization and Conciseness**: The findings are organized by system (General, HENT, Lungs, Heart, Abdominal, Skin, Neuro) and are concise without excessive irrelevant details.

5. **Missing Pertinent Negatives**: While the findings are mostly comprehensive, there are no explicit mentions of other potential pertinent negatives that could have been included, such as the absence of respiratory distress or the absence of other systemic signs.

Given this analysis, the key physical exam findings are mostly present, well organized, and concise. However, there is a minor issue regarding the normality of the vitals and the lack of mention of other pertinent negatives. 

Thus, the score would be a 3, as it meets the criteria for most key findings documented and organized but is missing some pertinent negatives.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a 63yo M who presents with colicky pain in the right flank associated with nausea without fever
Response: Let's evaluate the provided statement against the rubric and answer key.

The key elements from the answer key are:
1. Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2. Right flank pain
3. 10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4. Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional: Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile

Now, let's analyze the statement: "Mr. Ryan is a 63yo M who presents with colicky pain in the right flank associated with nausea without fever."

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours** - This information is not explicitly stated.
2. **Right flank pain** - This is present ("colicky pain in the right flank").
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity** - This information is not provided.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves** - This is present ("colicky pain").
5. **Optional elements** - There is mention of nausea, which is not in the optional list, and "without fever" suggests afebrile status.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Missing elements: Acute onset, 10/10 intensity or severe intensity.
- Present: Right flank pain, colicky pain (which implies spasms), and the optional element of being afebrile.

Since there are two essential elements missing (acute onset and intensity), and the statement does not exceed five total elements, it fits the criteria for a score of 2.

Final score: 2

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1) Nephrolithiasis 2) Pyelonephritis
Response: The differential diagnosis provided includes nephrolithiasis (kidney stone) and pyelonephritis (UTI). Both of these conditions are relevant to the symptoms typically associated with renal colic and urinary tract infections. 

1. Nephrolithiasis is a primary consideration when a patient presents with symptoms such as severe flank pain, hematuria, and possibly urinary symptoms, which aligns well with the findings.
2. Pyelonephritis is also a pertinent diagnosis, particularly if there are accompanying symptoms such as fever or chills, which could indicate a kidney infection stemming from a UTI.

The provided differential diagnoses are both consistent with the findings and appropriately prioritized based on common clinical presentations. There are no significant flaws in the prioritization that would impact patient care negatively.

Given this analysis, the score for the differential diagnosis is:

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1) 1 day history of acute, colicky, severe pain is consistent with kidney stones. PE finding of costovertebral angle tenderness is also consistent. He states that his diet is not great, and this could be a contributing factor. Dysuria and frequency are uncommon with nephrolithiasis, but do not exclude the diagnosis. 2) Associated symptoms of dysuria and frequency are common with pyelonephritis as is the physical exam finding of costovertebral angle tenderness. However, there is no suprapubic tenderness or fever present making this diagnosis less likely
Response: The provided support for the differential diagnosis includes relevant information for both nephrolithiasis and UTI/pyelonephritis. 

1) The first part correctly identifies the symptoms and links them to nephrolithiasis. The description of the pain as acute, colicky, and severe aligns well with the expected presentation of kidney stones. The mention of costovertebral angle tenderness adds further support, although it is not a definitive finding for nephrolithiasis alone. The acknowledgment of dietary factors is a reasonable consideration, even if not directly linked to the diagnosis. The note about dysuria and frequency being uncommon but not exclusionary is appropriate, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the condition.

2) The second part correctly identifies that dysuria and frequency are symptoms associated with pyelonephritis and notes the relevance of costovertebral angle tenderness. However, it appropriately points out the absence of suprapubic tenderness and fever, which are significant in ruling out this diagnosis, indicating a good understanding of the condition's presentation.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well-supported with relevant findings and appropriate reasoning. The links to the diagnoses are mostly correct, although the discussion of dysuria in relation to nephrolithiasis could be clearer. However, the overall assessment remains strong, and the reasoning is sound.

Given these considerations, I would assign a score of 3 for this section.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Plan for diagnostic workup is effective and efficient, includes all essential tests, and few or no unnecessary tests
3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1) Urinalysis and urine culture to rule out bacterial infection 2) Abdominal CT to check for kidney stones
Response: To evaluate the plan provided, we need to determine if it includes the required, acceptable, and unacceptable tests according to the rubric.

1) The plan includes a urinalysis (UA), which is required and appropriate for ruling out bacterial infection.
2) The plan also includes an abdominal CT, which is acceptable for checking for kidney stones.

However, the plan does not include a BMP or renal ultrasound, which are acceptable tests that could have been included. The abdominal CT is relevant and necessary for the differential diagnosis of kidney stones, but it could be argued that it may not be the most efficient initial test compared to a renal ultrasound, which could be less invasive.

Overall, the plan includes essential tests and is reasonable, but it also includes an unnecessary test (the abdominal CT) when a renal ultrasound could suffice. Therefore, I would rate this plan as a 3.

3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: Patient presents today for right flank pain of 24 hour duration. Per patient, pain is sharp and intermittent in nature. When the pain comes on it will last for up to 20 minutes and is a 9/10 at its worst. Patient states that the pain will radiate from his back to his groin. He has associated nausea, vomiting, urinary urgency and dysuria. Patient has taken Tylenol with no relief. He denied experiencing anything similar to this before. ROS: As per HPI, otherwise negative PMH: Gout PSH: None FH: Gallstones in mom; HBP in dad SH: Works as insurance salesman, rarely drinks EtOH, denied tobacco products and illicit drug use Medications: none Allergies: none
Response: The provided HPI includes several key components, but it also has some omissions and disorganization. 

1. The symptom of right flank pain is mentioned, along with the duration of 24 hours, which is accurate.
2. The description of the pain as sharp is present, but it is described as intermittent rather than spasms or colic every 1-2 hours, which is a deviation from the answer key.
3. The severity of the pain is included (9/10), which is correct.
4. Associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting are noted, but the description of the vomiting is vague (not specified as clear or nonbloody/nonbilious).
5. Urinary urgency and dysuria are documented, but there is no mention of hematuria, which is a pertinent negative that is missing.

Overall, while there is a fair amount of relevant information, there are key elements missing or inaccurately described, particularly regarding the nature of the pain and the specifics of the vomiting. This leads to a disorganized presentation of the information.

Given these considerations, I would score this HPI as a 2, as it contains many key historical findings but is disorganized and omits some important details.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: T-99.7 F HR- 85 BPM RR-16 BP-128/82 O2-99% ORA Physical exam General: AAOx3, ill appearing HEENT: Mucous membranes moist, no erythema Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, symmetrical chest rise Heart: RRR, no rubs, skips, murmurs GI: Abdomen nontender to light and deep palpation, no masses or hernias MSK: Positive right flank tenderness to percussion, no bruises or joint swelling Neuro: CN II-XII grossly intact, no focal deficits, normal gait Psych: Appropriate mood and affect, not responding to internal stimuli 
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam (PE) findings against the rubric, we need to identify the key components that were outlined in the answer key.

The answer key specifies:
1. Normal vitals
2. Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
3. No abdominal tenderness

Now, let's analyze the provided physical exam findings:

1. **Vitals**: The vitals are provided and show a slight fever (T-99.7 F) but are otherwise stable. This does not meet the "normal" criteria as stated in the answer key.
2. **Costovertebral angle tenderness**: The exam notes "Positive right flank tenderness to percussion," which is consistent with costovertebral angle tenderness.
3. **Abdominal tenderness**: The exam states "Abdomen nontender to light and deep palpation," which indicates that there is no abdominal tenderness, consistent with the answer key.

Now, let’s assess the scoring based on the rubric:

- The key positive finding of costovertebral angle tenderness is documented.
- The absence of abdominal tenderness is also documented.
- However, the vital signs are not entirely "normal," as there is a slight fever.

Overall, the physical exam findings are mostly well organized and relevant, but there is a critical omission in meeting the "normal vitals" requirement. Additionally, there are no pertinent negatives missing, as the relevant findings are all documented.

Based on this analysis, I would assign a score of 3, as most key positive findings are documented and well organized, but the vital signs being not entirely normal detracts from a perfect score.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "acute onset" and "24 hour duration," which satisfies this criterion.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement explicitly mentions "right flank pain," which meets this requirement.
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of the pain is not specified in the statement, so this essential element is missing.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: The statement describes the pain as exacerbated by percussion but does not mention spasms, colic, or waves of pain, so this element is also missing.

The statement does not include the optional elements, but they are not required for scoring. 

Based on the evaluation:
- Two essential elements are missing (intensity and description of pain pattern).
- Therefore, the summary statement is missing multiple essential elements.

According to the rubric, this would score a 2.

system: I am a medical educator and I would like your help grading an assignment. My students recently completed an activity where they interviewed a patient about their symptoms. I have made a scoring rubric that includes the information that should be reported in their post-interview note. The rubric is broken into individual steps. To help you out, I just want you to score each individual section that I will provide you one by one.Please score each individual section that I provide you based off the rubric and the answer key. Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Pertinent, prioritized differential diagnosis reflecting correct interpretation of findings
3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Iliolumbar abscess
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis provided, we need to compare it to the answer key and the rubric.

1. The first diagnosis, nephrolithiasis, is correct and aligns with the answer key.
2. The second diagnosis, pyelonephritis, is also correct and aligns with the answer key.
3. The third diagnosis, iliolumbar abscess, does not appear in the answer key and is not a typical differential diagnosis for the symptoms likely being considered in this case.

The differential diagnosis reflects a good understanding of the pertinent conditions related to the symptoms, but the inclusion of the iliolumbar abscess detracts from the overall accuracy. However, nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis are prioritized correctly.

Based on the rubric:
- The first two conditions are consistent with findings.
- The third condition introduces a flaw, making the overall differential somewhat consistent but inaccurately prioritized.

Thus, I would assign a score of 2 for this differential diagnosis.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Excellent differential diagnosis well supported, links to diagnoses are correct and complete
3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting
-- clear mucus or nonbloody/nonbilious
- PMH of gout

UTI/pyelonephritis
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
- nausea and vomiting
- dysuria and/or urgency
- positive costovertebral angle tenderness

muscle strain
- right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Patient is experiencing severe pain that radiates to his groin. The pain is intermittent and he has not had any relief with Tylenol. He also reports urinary urgency and dysuria. He has severe tenderness upon percussion of right flank. He has a PMH of gout which could be associated with the kidney stone. 2. Patient has tenderness to percussion over the right kidney. This could be from inflammation of the kidney secondary to an infection. He also has a fever, which we would expect to be present with pyelonephritis. However, the severe and intermittent pain points more towards nephrolithiasis. 3. Iliolumbar abscess is a possibility due to the patient having severe pain in his right flank and a fever. The tenderness to percussion of the right flank could be explained by inflammation in of the area secondary to an infection. However, I would expect this pain to be constant and for his gait to be affected, which is why this is last on my differential
Response: The provided support demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the differential diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms. Here's the evaluation based on the rubric:

1. The first point discusses severe pain radiating to the groin, which is consistent with nephrolithiasis. It also mentions urinary urgency and dysuria, which aligns with UTI/pyelonephritis. The tenderness upon percussion of the right flank supports both nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis. The reference to a PMH of gout is relevant for nephrolithiasis, linking the history to the current presentation. This section effectively supports the differential diagnosis with accurate links.

2. The second point acknowledges the tenderness over the right kidney and the presence of fever, which supports the possibility of pyelonephritis. However, it also correctly emphasizes that the severe and intermittent pain aligns more with nephrolithiasis. This section provides a strong rationale for prioritizing nephrolithiasis in the differential diagnosis while still considering pyelonephritis.

3. The third point introduces iliolumbar abscess as a possibility but correctly notes that the presentation is not entirely consistent with that diagnosis due to the expected characteristics of pain and gait changes. This demonstrates critical thinking, although it is less relevant than the previous two points.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is well-supported, with correct links to the findings and appropriate consideration of potential diagnoses. The reasoning is clear and comprehensive, making it a strong presentation.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 4.

3) Reasonable plan for diagnostic workup, includes most essential but also some unnecessary tests
2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: CT scan of abdomen and pelvis U/A and urine culture labs
Response: The provided plan includes a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, a urinalysis (U/A), and urine culture labs. 

Evaluating against the rubric:
- The U/A is required and included.
- The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is acceptable.
- However, urine culture labs are not mentioned in the answer key as either required or acceptable, which could be considered unnecessary or irrelevant in this context.

The plan includes the essential U/A and a reasonable acceptable test (CT scan), but it also introduces an additional test (urine culture) that is not specified in the answer key. Therefore, while the plan is reasonable overall, it includes some unnecessary tests.

Based on these observations, I would score this plan as a 3.

Summary:
Nathaniel Ryan is a 25 year old male presenting with acute onset right flank pain of 24 hour duration. The pain radiated to his groin and is exacerbated by percussion of right flank. 

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis 3. Iliolumbar abscess

Supporting Information:
1. Patient is experiencing severe pain that radiates to his groin. The pain is intermittent and he has not had any relief with Tylenol. He also reports urinary urgency and dysuria. He has severe tenderness upon percussion of right flank. He has a PMH of gout which could be associated with the kidney stone. 2. Patient has tenderness to percussion over the right kidney. This could be from inflammation of the kidney secondary to an infection. He also has a fever, which we would expect to be present with pyelonephritis. However, the severe and intermittent pain points more towards nephrolithiasis. 3. Iliolumbar abscess is a possibility due to the patient having severe pain in his right flank and a fever. The tenderness to percussion of the right flank could be explained by inflammation in of the area secondary to an infection. However, I would expect this pain to be constant and for his gait to be affected, which is why this is last on my differential

Response: The organization of the provided note is quite clear and follows a logical structure. The information is presented in appropriate sections: History of Present Illness (HPI), Physical Examination, Summary, Differential Diagnosis, Supporting Information, and Plan. Each section is clearly labeled, and the information within those sections is relevant and appropriately placed, with no significant repetition or missing sections.

However, while the organization is strong, there are minor areas where the flow could be improved, such as ensuring that the supporting information directly relates to the differential diagnosis in a more structured manner. Nonetheless, the overall organization is effective and meets the criteria set out in the rubric.

Based on this evaluation, I would assign a score of 4.

Please think through this step-by-step.Please place their final score after your explanation all by itself as an integer with no markup
user: Refer to the rubric: 4) Almost all key information is present, concise and well organized with little irrelevant information
3) Most key positive historical findings are documented and well organized, missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key historical findings are omitted. History is disorganized or poorly documented (obscuring what is key) 
1) Key history findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for hpi: Right flank pain
- x24 hours or acute
- Sharp
- Spasms OR Colic every 1-2 hours 
- Severe or 9/10 pain
Nausea and vomiting
- Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious
Dysuria and/or urgency
No hematuria. Please evaluate the following hpi and provide a score: HPI -Middle aged male with 24 hours right flank pain -Pain is a sharp spasm every 1-2 hours that radiates from back towards groin -Has nausea, vomited a few times -Some urinary urgency and dysuria -Tried Tylenol which did not seem to help -Never had anything like this happen before ROS: denies hematuria, fevers, chills PMH: gout Allergies: none Meds: none PSH: none FH: mother with cholelithiasis, father with T2DM and hypertension SH: works as insurance manager, rarely drinks alcohol, no tobacco, no drugs
Response: To evaluate the HPI provided, we will compare it against the answer key for completeness and organization.

1. **Right flank pain**: The note mentions "24 hours right flank pain," which is accurate.
2. **Acute**: The time frame of "24 hours" suggests it is acute.
3. **Sharp pain**: The description includes "Pain is a sharp spasm," which matches.
4. **Spasms or colic every 1-2 hours**: The note states "spasm every 1-2 hours," which aligns with the key.
5. **Severe or 9/10 pain**: The severity of pain is not explicitly mentioned in terms of a numerical scale (9/10).
6. **Nausea and vomiting**: Nausea is mentioned, and "vomited a few times" is consistent with the key.
7. **Clear or nonbloody/nonbilious vomiting**: The note does not specify whether the vomit was clear or nonbloody/nonbilious.
8. **Dysuria and/or urgency**: The note mentions "Some urinary urgency and dysuria," which is correct.
9. **No hematuria**: The review of systems (ROS) states "denies hematuria," which is accurate.

Overall, the HPI contains most of the key information but is missing explicit indications of the severity of pain (9/10) and the characteristics of the vomiting. The organization is clear, but the lack of specific details regarding pain severity and the nature of vomiting detracts from completeness.

Given these points, I would score this HPI as follows:
- The majority of key historical findings are documented and well organized, but it is missing some important details.

Thus, this HPI would receive a score of 3.

3) Most key positive physical exam findings are documented and well organized, but missing pertinent negatives
2) Many key physical exam findings are omitted. Exam is disorganized or extensively detailed (obscuring what is key)
1) Key physical exam findings are inaccurately documented or omitted. Here is the answer key for pex: Normal vitals 
Positive costovertebral angle tenderness
No abdominal tenderness. Please evaluate the following pex and provide a score: Vitals: Temp 99.7 F, HR 85, RR 16, BP 128/82, SpO2 99% on RA General: not in acute distress, well nourished HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, no cervical LAD, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, no murmurs, no LE edema, +2 PT pulses bilaterally Resp: LCAT Abd: bowel sounds present, no TTP, no rebound, Rosvings sign negative, right CVA tenderness MSK: 5/5 upper and lower extremity strength bilaterally
Response: To evaluate the provided physical exam findings against the rubric, we will assess the completeness, organization, and relevance of the documented findings.

1. **Key Findings Present**: The note includes a comprehensive list of physical exam findings, including normal vitals, general appearance, HEENT, cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and musculoskeletal assessments. 

2. **Conciseness and Organization**: The findings are organized by system, which helps in understanding the patient's condition. However, while most key findings are documented, there is a lack of pertinent negatives, such as specific mentions of any neurological deficits or skin findings.

3. **Irrelevant Information**: The note does not contain irrelevant information; all findings seem relevant to the patient's assessment.

4. **Omitted Findings**: The note could improve by including some pertinent negatives that could help clarify the patient's condition, such as neurological examination results or a more detailed assessment of the skin.

Based on the rubric:
- The note contains almost all key physical exam findings.
- It is concise and well organized.
- However, some pertinent negatives are missing.

Given this evaluation, I would score this section a 3, as it meets the criteria for most key positive findings being documented and well organized, but it lacks some pertinent negatives.

user: Refer to the rubric: 4) All essential elements present, and statement has 5 or fewer total elements
3) Missing 1 essential element and/or statement has more than 5 total elements
2) Missing multiple essential elements
1) No summary statement included. Here is the answer key for sum: 1.	Acute onset OR past 24 hours
2.	Right flank pain
3.	10/10 intensity OR severe intensity
4.	Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves
Optional.	Non-bilious vomiting OR Right groin pain OR afebrile. Please evaluate the following sum and provide a score: Mr. Ryan is a middle aged male with a history of gout presenting with 1 day of right flank pain, n/v, and dysuria.
Response: To evaluate the provided summary statement based on the rubric, we need to identify the essential elements present in Mr. Ryan's note.

1. **Acute onset OR past 24 hours**: The statement mentions "1 day," which indicates acute onset.
2. **Right flank pain**: The statement includes "right flank pain."
3. **10/10 intensity OR severe intensity**: The intensity of pain is not specified in the statement.
4. **Spasms OR colic OR pain comes in waves**: This information is not included in the statement.
5. **Optional elements**: The statement mentions "n/v" (nausea/vomiting) and "dysuria," which could be considered optional elements.

Now, let's assess the total elements:
- Present: Acute onset, right flank pain, and optional element of n/v.
- Missing: Severity of pain, description of pain (spasms/colic), and any mention of the optional elements like right groin pain or afebrile status.

The summary statement contains 3 essential elements (acute onset, right flank pain, and nausea/vomiting) but is missing 2 essential elements (intensity and description of pain). Since it has more than 5 total elements (considering the optional elements), it falls into the category of missing multiple essential elements.

Based on the rubric:
- Missing multiple essential elements = Score of 2.

Final score: 2

3) Differential diagnosis generally consistent with findings, with minor flaws in prioritization that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Differential diagnosis somewhat consistent with findings, but overly broad and/or inaccurately prioritized
1) Differential diagnosis is inconsistent with findings. Here is the answer key for ddx: 1) nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
2) UTI/pyelonephritis
Optional) muscle strain
Optional) inguinal hernia. Please evaluate the following ddx and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis 2. Pyelonephritis
Response: The provided differential diagnosis includes nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis, which are both relevant to the symptoms typically associated with kidney-related issues. These two conditions align well with the findings that might be expected based on a patient presenting with renal colic or urinary symptoms. 

However, the answer key also includes optional diagnoses such as muscle strain and inguinal hernia, which could potentially be considered depending on the broader context of the patient's symptoms. The absence of these optional diagnoses does not detract significantly from the relevance of the primary diagnoses provided.

Overall, the differential diagnosis is consistent with the findings and demonstrates a good prioritization of the most likely conditions. Therefore, I would score this section as a 3.

3) Appropriately supported differential diagnosis, with missing or incorrect links that would not negatively impact patient care
2) Weakly supported differential diagnosis, with several incorrect links between findings and diagnosis
1) Differential diagnosis lacks accurate links to patient findings. Here is the answer key for support: nephrolithiasis/kidney stone/renal colic
- Right flank pain
-- x24 hours or acute
-- sharp
-- intermittent or colic
-- severe or 9/10 pain
- nausea and vomiting

-- sharp
- recent new workout (rowing machine)

inguinal hernia
- right groin pain
- recent new workout. Please evaluate the following support and provide a score: 1. Nephrolithiasis -history of gout -acute onset -CVA tenderness -right flank pain radiating to groin -spasmodic nature of pain -nausea/vomiting -urinary urgency, dysuria -no fever/chills 2. Pyelonephritis -right flank pain/CVA tenderness -nausea/vomiting -urinary urgency, dysuria 
Response: To evaluate the differential diagnosis support provided, we will analyze the links made to the diagnoses based on the answer key.

1. **Nephrolithiasis**:
   - History of gout: This is relevant and supports the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis.
   - Acute onset: This is also appropriate and consistent with nephrolithiasis.
   - CVA tenderness: This is a relevant finding but is more indicative of pyelonephritis.
   - Right flank pain radiating to groin: This is correct and supports nephrolithiasis.
   - Spasmodic nature of pain: This is consistent with the colicky pain of nephrolithiasis.
   - Nausea/vomiting: This symptom aligns with nephrolithiasis.
   - Urinary urgency, dysuria: These symptoms are more commonly associated with urinary tract infections or pyelonephritis, although they can occur with nephrolithiasis.
   - No fever/chills: The absence of fever/chills may support nephrolithiasis over pyelonephritis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis for nephrolithiasis is mostly well-supported, but the inclusion of CVA tenderness and urinary urgency/dysuria introduces some incorrect links that could lead to confusion with pyelonephritis. 

2. **Pyelonephritis**:
   - Right flank pain/CVA tenderness: This is accurate and supports pyelonephritis.
   - Nausea/vomiting: This is also relevant for pyelonephritis.
   - Urinary urgency, dysuria: These symptoms are appropriate for pyelonephritis.

The differential diagnosis for pyelonephritis is well-supported and correctly links the findings to the diagnosis.

Overall, the differential diagnosis presented has some strong links, particularly for pyelonephritis, but there are also some incorrect or misleading links for nephrolithiasis due to the inclusion of symptoms more relevant to UTI/pyelonephritis. Therefore, the overall support is appropriate but not without flaws.

Based on this analysis, I would assign a score of 3 for the differential diagnosis.

2) Ineffective plan for diagnostic workup, essential tests missed and/or irrelevant tests included (“shotgunning”)
1) Diagnostic workup is inconsistent with differential diagnoses and/or places patient at unnecessary risk. Here is the answer key for plan: Required: UA
Acceptable: CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, renal ultrasound
Unacceptable: endoscopy. Please evaluate the following plan and provide a score: 1. CT stone protocol (non contrast) 2. UA with urine culture 3. CBC 4. BMP
Response: To evaluate the provided plan for diagnostic workup, we need to compare it against the rubric and the answer key.

The required test is a UA, which is included in the plan. The acceptable tests include CT abdomen/pelvis, BMP, and renal ultrasound. The plan includes:
1. CT stone protocol (non-contrast) - acceptable
2. UA with urine culture - required
3. CBC - not listed as required or acceptable
4. BMP - acceptable

In this plan, the essential test (UA) is included. However, the CBC is not necessary as per the answer key, which means there is one unnecessary test included. The plan does not miss any essential tests, but it does include one irrelevant test, which indicates a reasonable plan but with some unnecessary components.

Based on the rubric:
- Since the plan includes most essential tests but also some unnecessary tests, it falls under the second category.

Therefore, the score for this plan is 3.
